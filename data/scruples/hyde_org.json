		"story": "   Throwaway for obvious reasons.\n\n   I dropped out of uni 2 years ago because I was planning on moving to a different country and going to Uni there. However, my parents didn't want to help me in any way and I couldn't afford it myself. They've always supported my younger sister though, bought her an apartment and they're even paying her bills, even though she earns enough money to do that herself. So atm I'm stuck at home with them, which sucks as I am 25 yo and I feel like I'm wasting my life completely.\n\n   Both my parents were extremely abusive, especially my dad. As a result, I have social anxiety, trust issues, panic attacks etc. I can deal with everything as I got used to it anyway, but lately things have gotten worse.\n\n   A few years ago my dad was diagnosed with type II diabetes, and he retired. He's been staying at home ever since and he's slowly but surely becoming a vegetable. He had a stroke which left him unable to speak/walk properly. I'm no doctor, but I found his hospital records and even talked to a nurse, and she said he's a bloody mess and he could die at any time. The worst part is, he doesn't realise what's happening around him anymore. He leaves the apartment door open at night, he forgets stuff on the stove, and he makes a huge mess everywhere. I talked to my mum about this, I don't feel safe with him around. He clearly lost his mind but she refuses to acknowledge it. Throughout the years, I've tried to tell her there's something really wrong with him, but she always just shrugged it off. He was an awful husband, so she doesn't love him, but she says she feels pity for him.\n\n   I suggested we put him in a retirement home, as he clearly cannot take care of himself and he's putting our lives in danger. I sleep with ear plugs because he slams doors/drops things all the time. I'm afraid he might set our apartment on fire or worse. My mum doesn't want to do that because she's afraid of his reaction; she thinks he's going to get a heart attack if she tries to bring it up. He's always hated hospitals and he always refused treatment, even when he got bitten by a stray dog, even after his stroke, so I see where my mum is coming from. However, I've had enough.\n\n   Yesterday I heard him choke, he was struggling to breathe and honestly, it sounded like he was gonna die. And I was relieved. My first instinct wasn't to help him, instead I kept doing my skincare, honestly hoping he'd just die already. He didn't. I told my mum what happened when she got home and she thinks I'm a monster. But am I really? This person has abused me my entire life, has beaten the living shit out of me, hell he has even tried to kill me a few times. I know my life would get better if he died, my mum would sell our apartment and I'd finally have money to go to college and start my own life. So AITA for wanting my abusive father gone?",

It progressed very quickly within months of our first meeting.\n\nWe agreed to an open relationship to be sure there was no weird feeling of lost opportunity due to our quick involvement. We do love each other very much and want a future together, but we both felt a certain stagnation and tension early on.\n\nRecently, though our relationship has been going really well, we haven't had sex in a while. I've tried to initiate, but with little to no success. I don't push too hard because I don't want to be that person. I don't resent my SO because they're very available emotionally and physically affectionate in small ways. Just no sex.\n\nI've had sex with others in this time. Including an ex that had been kind of an issue in the past. I did not mention this to my SO...\n\nHere's where it gets tricky. I found out that they started up a tinder profile again without telling me, as well as had sex with someone within the past few weeks. It's been months for us. I knew they had gone out and kind of guessed what happened and thought I was fine with it... and yet having it confirmed hurt a lot considering how I've been trying to be more intimate, only to be shut down. It got me really upset and jealous.\n\nI haven't brought it up or shown signs that I know, yet. I feel like I have no ground to stand on since it's an open relationship, but also because of sleeping with my ex. But I still can't help that it hurts and I'm annoyed at their apparent choice to only seek other sexual partners. I'm 100% willing to get over myself if I have to, but I needed to confirm if I'm the stupid hypocrite I think I am.\n\nTL;DR: in an open relationship with not much sex. Slept with ex. Despite our relationship being very emotionally stable and my trying to initiate intimacy, SO sleeps with others but not me. I'm upset about this.\n\nAITA?",

Where I was Tinder-ing it up and having a good time. I met this beautiful Filipino girl and we started hooking up. As far as I knew, we were FWB but exclusive. She said she wasn't with anyone else. Well, 3 weeks in and she shares with me that she has been with this guy, but they aren't sexually active. She wants to remain friends and go exclusive with him. Kinda hurts but I agree.  \n\n\nWe become friends on Facebook and eventually she invites me to parties and what not. I am a bit weary but eventually get over it. Then she shares with everyone that she's pregnant. Doing the math I figured she would either have been lying about not being with anyone else sexually, or it's mine. I consulted online and asked a few local doctors and they all confirm that I'm likely the father (but obviously a paternity test would be required); and to clarify, she's telling everyone that the guy she's with is the father.  \n\n\nWell she has the baby and I decide to not be friends with her because I sensed a lot of dishonesty, and I knew she wouldn't be honest. Still, I check in on Facebook and the baby has a lot of the same features as me. Dark hair (both of them are lighter brunettes), oval face (same as me), and a lighter complexion (she's filipino, he's indian, I'm caucasion).  \n\n\nI just sort of live with these details. I mean it sucks but whatever. Then fast forward to present minus a few weeks I see the dad and baby at a supermarket and we get to talking. I've been going through a lot in my life between being professionally stifled and regrets for not going after personal goals more tirelessly. I just feel like I have nothing to lose, and this whole ordeal is 100% a factor. So he mentions how the baby doesn't look like him at all and yeah definitely doesn't so I say \"Yeah, looks kinda like me actually\" and it's like 1,000 lightbulbs went off in his head. I explained the whole situation to him about what happened and how I suspect the baby may be mine.  \n\n\nWell he's devastated, and leaves. I then get 100+ facebook messages from the girl saying how I'm the asshole and how I'm stirring up shit. I don't think I am, I just proposed that I have some suspicions and pointed them out.

I've mostly had rejections but I've recently had some luck with manuscript requests. The publishing industry is fucking difficult to break into, I'm under no illusion that I'll be published or even get an agent. It's a game of patience. I wouldn't dream of telling other people to not write because everyone should be allowed to explore and express their creativity, no matter what your language abilities are.\n\nBasically, I have a friend who wants to be a professional writer. We've been friends since we were teenagers (we are in our late 20s) s but she's always been a bit manic. She gets these flights of fancies and grand ideas that she usually doesn't follow through. We're both Swedish, but I've spent most of my life living abroad in English speaking countries, did half my Education and my university degree in English, I've been working and living the UK for eight years. I've spoken English since I was four years old and am a native speaker. She isn't. Her spoken and written English is very basic.\n\nShe's been writing a book in English for a while and every now and again she sends it to me to read which I'm grateful for. The story itself is an okay premise but the plot doesn't always make sense and the quality of the language is really poor. I've been helping her edit, pointing out how to structure it a bit and with some grammar. She's never been good at taking feedback or constructive criticism and at school, she was difficult to work with. She sent the novel to one of her friends who read it and called her \"the next JK Rowling\". After this, she has been convinced that she's going to make it in publishing and has been wanting to send the unfinished manuscript to literary agencies in both Sweden and the UK/US. She had convinced herself that they were going to take the unfinished script and she would have a bestseller on her hand.\n\nI tried telling her patiently that it takes time getting into publishing, that most authors don't get a bestseller with their first debut novel and she wouldn't listen. I then told her it's a bad idea to send out an unfinished novel, that hasn't been edited and that's written in a language that visibly isn't your mother-tongue and that it in all likelihood will not be picked up or even read by agencies.

They moved SUPER fast. They met on Tinder, talked for about a month before meeting in person, went on 5 dates over 5 days. By the 6th day, they were a couple. They exchanged \"I love you\" in less than a month. They met each other's families by the 2nd week and their families met each other by their 2nd month. They moved in with each other after only a year.\n\nThey both make decent money, don't get me wrong. She is an interior designer and he is a pharmacy owner. That's not why I'm concerned. I think he has been taking advantage of her. Here is why:\n\n\\- They have been looking at houses together for a while. Kylie is going to design and furnish the house. Avery does not seem to be involved in the design process and it does not seem like he is going to pay Kylie or pay for the furniture.\n\n\\- When they moved in together, Avery started using Kylie's car to get to work a lot. This meant Kylie had to work from home. He has his own car. Kylie's is newer, so I think he just likes using hers because it was newer and fancier than his. \n\n\\-  She bought a new iMac and Macbook to use for work at home and when travelling. He borrows her Macbook when he goes to work and she stays home. But he has the money to buy his own laptop. He just loves to use her stuff and not have to buy his own.\n\n\\- Kylie cleans way more than Avery. He will leave dishes in the sink overnight, she will wash them right away. He is just using her so he does not have to do chores.\n\nAnyway, Kylie and Avery went on a trip recently. They were gone for 10 days. About 4 days in, she sent me a photo of a ring on her finger. I didn't reply because I knew if I did it wouldn't be nice. They got back earlier today. Kylie came into my work waving her hand at me to show me the ring. She asked if I saw her texts and why I didn't reply to her. I said I didn't know what to say. She pestered me until it lead to me saying that I think she moved way too fast with Avery. He is using her and she is blind to it. I told her that I always bit my tongue throughout their relationship because I expected them to break up eventually, but the fact that they're engaged is a huge red flag.\n\nWe got in a huge fight. She said she couldn't believe how unsupportive I was being, but I told her she's the one who asked to know what I thought.

He admitted he liked me as well and wish he hadn't started dating someone else (at this point, they had already broken up). I felt like I still kind of liked Joseph but I once again didn't want to pursue anything because I love Toni and I was happy.

I always noticed that she had some kind of crush on me or was at least very very interested in me and my life, which is nice because she was one of the first people in my life that were really interested in me. I appreciated her, she appreciated me and we helped eachother through various periods of our lives. From bad breakups to divorce or the death of a close family member. \n\nNow to the actual story. It all started like 4 months ago. She asked me if I had a crush on anyone. I didn't and told her so.  She kept digging, asking me again and again. After I told her that she is getting kinda annoying her best girl friend started asking me instead of her. I told her the same, then some of my friends started asking me if I had a crush. I told them all no, until I said \"no and I wouldn't tell you if I had one\".Which is the worst you can say, even if it's the truth.\n\nAnd then things got worse. My best friend started asking me again and again and I got soo annoyed. Everyone pressured me so extremely and they all wanted me to say that I crush her (my best friend). \n\nI thought about the whole situation and after getting asked even more and more and being pressured on parties I started adapting to the idea. I thought that if everyone wants me to say it I should at least think about the possibility. I started to kinda like the idea and maybe felt something close to a crush. \n\nAfter the 4 months of pressure and getting asked about it I finally told my best friend that I was kinda crushing on her in the past 2 weeks. She got excited and told me that she had a crush on me for the last year, maybe even more. We had a fun evening, but I never had the feeling or desire to do anything couple related (hugging, kissing, cuddle, etc.) I didn't spend the night with her but used some random excuse to get away from the situation because with every minute that passed the situation got more and more uncomfortable.\n\nWhen I got home I started thinking about the whole situation and came to the conclusion that I didn't like her in that particular way and after talking to her on the next day I told her that I think it would be best to stay friends. She of course didn't understand why I had change my mind. Tbh I had no clue myself. She left with almost tears in her eyes and I felt soo terrible but I needed some times and thought she would need time for herlself as well. After countless hours of thinking and arguing with myself, I figured that I wanted to satisfy the mass and put their hopes above my actual feelings.\n\nWe texted and I tried explaining her why I had changed my mind. She said that was all made up and that I would be weak for breaking under so little pressure. End of the story: we are still kinda friends, but haven't done anything since. \n\nSo please tell me AITA and if so why.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR; I told my best friend that I had a crush on her because I was pressured for over 4 months into saying it. The day after I told her that I was kinda crushing on her I wasn't really feeling that way anymore then told her that we should stay friends. She called me mentally weak and that it wouldn't work out anyways.",

When we got out of the car, the other guy was an older man who was clearly agitated but as god as my witness I did not hear him say anything rude, let alone derogatory towards my girlfriend's race. He had called the police even before getting out of the car and I think it took them less than 10 minutes to get there. My girlfriend sat in her car calling her parents while the other guy and I did our best to redirect traffic around the two cars. \n\nWhen the police came up my girlfriend instantly went from calm and collected to tears streaming down her face when they asked her what happened she said that she saw the other guy look at her and then from her perspective hit her car on purpose. She also said that as soon as he got out of the car he started screaming at her things like \"this is why m*****'s shouldn't be behind the wheel and that she's an n-word who would be better in chains among other things. I was speechless (and spineless) and kept telling myself \"say something, just say something\" but never did. \n\n\nThis clearly set the cops in her favor and the guy was ticketed for running the four way stop.

They also pretty much only all hang out when it's one of them that comes up with the plans. Every time I've ever asked them to go to a bar or something, everyone has some kind of excuse. One guy's excuse a lot of the time is about saving money. We'll call him Bob. Bob is also the guy in the group that any time we hang out with other people, he manages to say or do something that offends someone and creates an argument/awkward situation.\n\nSo the other day we're talking in a group chat about trying to plan a mini vacation over the summer and booking a vrbo house. Right away one of them sends a link as a suggestion and I check it out. It's really nice but kind of expensive for me, even when split between all of us. I say something like \"that's nice, but can we try to find something cheaper?\", but everyone else seems fine with it, including Bob. So since no one reacted to my objection, I make a joke like \"the dude who can't even afford to get a drink at a bar on a Friday night is cool with this place, and I'm the one trying to save some money?\" He says \"eat my ass\". I call him a \"poor bitch\". Nothing out of the ordinary, no big deal. But a couple minutes, and comments by other people later, he says \"Sorry guys, I can't afford to go on your fancy rich vacation, guess I'm out.\" So I just say \"hah ok\" because I can't tell how serious he's being at this point. Then he says \"I've literally never said I didn't have the money to do something, and if I did it's because I just didn't want to hang out.\" At that point it's noticeably awkward, and no one is saying anything. The conversation ends there and I'm thinking great, everybody thinks I'm a jerk now.\n\nFirst of all, I was just making a joke, a pretty tame one in my opinion, and this guy is the king of offensive jokes. Second, he pretty much said that when he's been using money as an excuse not to do something, he's just been lying instead of just saying that he doesn't want to hang out. So of course I would make a joke about you not having money because you're always saying it!\n\nI ended up texting him separately because it was driving me crazy, and basically apologizing for making the joke. He said \"money just isn't something we joke about because we all come from different financial situations.\" Which made me think ok maybe money really is tight for him and calling him poor really would be a dick move then. But I was the one not having the money to afford that house and complaining in the first place.\n\nAm I really the asshole here?",

The boy in question (18m) used to be her boyfriend but they broke up quickly, but on good terms. They always used to talk to each other and hangout often.\n\nSo now onto the story. Over the past months of me dating her, I would always have my suspicions of her going behind my back with him, but she assured me otherwise saying if she liked him she wouldn't have dated me and that she instead likes me. A couple months ago, shes asking if she could be around him more and give him hugs again (she's kinda known for giving out hugs so it's not strange) but i still feel very uncomfortable with her giving it to him. I asked her if she could refrain from hugging him and in general talking to him. She's done that, but sometimes brings up how she misses him\n\nHowever, yesterday she brought it up again and she said how he would always be nice to her, compliment her, and how he wouldn't make her feel insecure about her body. I asked her what she meant by this since i'm always doing the same, and was very confused by how i was making her insecure when i always tell her her body is beautiful and it's perfect (she's 4'9). She goes on to say how she feels like i never mean it even though i genuinely do, and she shrugs it off. She said that she only sees him as an amazing friend but would never be interested in him like that again. \n\nThis is where I asked her if she could show me her phone the texts between her and him, and if there was nothing suspicious then she can have my full trust with him, after making her promise she wouldn't delete any messages. She gives me a better offer of giving me her instagram password that second to look for myself. I agree, then an hour later she says forget it and that i should trust her regardless. I explained to her that i do feel like an asshole for asking her to see her texts but assured her i would stop being paranoid about him if i just saw it. she went back on the offer and instead agreed to show me in school tomorrow \n\nJust a side note: She always says she loves me and that i make her the happiest. She always says that she couldn't imagine living without me. I definitely know i'm paranoid and being an ass for invading her privacy, but i've just got this gut feeling. I guess i'll update this tomorrow. but please let me know, how big of an ass am i?",

He unsolicited, sent me pics of her in her lingerie, tells me not to tell mention it to Rauol as he'll be pissed. I oblige. This was about 2 months ago.\n\nI am at the bar with a few of my good buddies, who know both of them. I mention how Xavier is shooting his shot with pretty girl, and he sent me a pic and IMO she's super fine. They ask to see pic of girl in lingerie, I oblige, all of us have been friends 15+ years (Xavier included). I mention how it's still in the very early stages, and to not mention anything to Rauol. This was like a week after the picture was sent to me initially.\n\nI have never brought it up again socially, and have been in contact with him regarding how things are going. He tells me how he's been hanging with her and getting there, and how he actually really likes her. I'm super happy for him, as he hasn't dated in a while. Has plans for an actual date with her in a couple weeks. None of this is repeated. This was like 3 weeks ago.\n\nArbitrarily, he had been kinda smoozing all over this girls facebook, and Rauol definitely can see that.\n\nDay of the date, get a text from Xavier asking if I mentioned anything to Rauol. I say no, and mention how it's pretty obvious that himself and pretty girl are talking by social media. \n\nEnd of the night, get a text basically calling me a piece of shit. Saying that pretty girl knows he sent me pictures of her (says Rauol told her but then later says he doesn't know how), and she wasn't happy. Asking why the fuck I would parade her tits around the bar. That she found out after the date.\n\nI explain all the above, how I mentioned it to our mutual friends but it would surprise me if anyone said anything to Rauol. Told him I wasn't sure how she knew (truth). Apologized for even telling them. Explained how I wasn't making excuses, that I definitely said something and showed them, but that the story he has about me parading it around is just not true and exaggerated, again apologizing.\n\nShe wasn't nothing more to do with him at the moment and he said I made him look like an immature asshole....and I guess I did, but he also kind of was? I don't show pictures of girls to my friends who I'm interested in dating/gf/etc nor did I ask for them. \n\nI take full ownership of saying she sent him a picture which he sent me, and then showing said picture.

Both of my peers are very into body image, with one (the lead tech on site) being of smaller stature, but both work out daily, and the lead is pretty ripped.\n\nLast week my 2 co-workers and I were wiring a door where we had to pull 6 wires through a hole that was pre-drilled to fit 4. Rather than re-drill the hole, the lead decided that he was going to make them fit. \n\nThe wires weren't moving, so I said \"C'mon, put all your 95 pounds into it!\"\n\nHis immediate response was \"Yeah, I may only be 95 pounds, but I'm stronger than your fat ass will ever be.\"\n\nNow, I'm a bigger guy, but I feel like his response was WAY out of line.

My twin and I recently joined a pseudomilitaristic group called Civil Air Patrol. Think JROTC.  Ever since we did, my dad's been hounding us about physical fitness. This is fair. I'm not in great shape, and was in even worse when we started. He proposed an arrangement- we could only attend CAP if we ran two miles, three times a week. Since we wanted to attend CAP, we agreed, and have been running for nearly three years now.\n\nEarlier this year, I got sick of the shape I was in, and started really putting some effort into working out. I downloaded an app to help me workout at home, because they don't let me go to the gym, I started really pushing myself on running, and even taking the dog for running in the evenings. Eventually, he put a stop to that last one, telling me it was too dangerous to go out when it's dark.  But still! I was improving, and everything reflected that. \n\nSo now we're up to yesterday. It was cold (36°F), and rainy. Not running weather. Since he excuses us for cold weather or rain separately, I texted him the circumstances, so he would see them when he woke up, and did a workout in my room instead. When he woke up, I told him that I had worked out. He nodded, and seemed content. \n\nYesterday evening though, he asked why we hadn't run. I repeated what I'd said in my text. He said sometimes it was cold and wet, and that we should've run anyway. And that even if we didn't run, we should've worked out. I explained that I had worked out, and told him about it, and he got angry, and explained that he wanted us to do *cardio*, on an exercise bike. I apologize. Ok, that's fair, sorry, should've done cardio. \n\nSo now that we've established my and my sister's fault, he moves towards punishment.  \"What can I do to help you do better?\" That might sound supportive, but his idea of helping is offering \"incentive\" to obey better in the future. When we were younger, these incentives were primarily spanking us with a belt. Now that we're older, he mostly just confiscates \"distractions\". \n\nI suggest that he shouldn't. That getting out of shape is a natural consequence of not working out, and if he wants us to develop self discipline, which he professes to be his motive, he should let us face the natural consequences of our decisions.\n\nHe doesn't like that. He says that he \"Doesn't care about *why* we obey, only *that* we obey.\".\n\nThis is old ground. We've argued before over whether only logic matters in decisions, or whether emotion has some stake. I am firmly on the latter, he won't budge from the former. \n\nWe go back and forth for a while about whether intent and motivation matter. He says a number of things minimizing my progress in running, says that he tried to instill self discipline in us but \"doesn't know where he went wrong with [my twin].\" At one point, I'm frustrated with cutting remarks, and begin crying. Eventually he issues another statement. \"I care that *you* care about the why.\" This seems contradictory to his earlier statement, so I bring it up and compare the two. He says I'm gaslighting him. \n\nThings escalated fiercely after that; I don't say anything in my defense, but my sister tells him the thought of me gaslighting anyone is ridiculous. I attempt to interject, as now the two of them are arguing over what I said,  using a phrase he used earlier - \"I'm here, luckily, so I can clarify my own statements\".  He yells that I'm \"immature, petty, and not worth talking to like an adult\", and sends me to bed. We haven't talked since. \n\nI know I could've conducted myself better, and even this portrayal is probably unfair. I wasn't trying to be manipulative, but crying could've been underhanded.  I don't think I was gaslighting him, but I also don't know enough about gaslighting to say either way. \n\nAm I the asshole?",

		"story": "My good friend struggles a bit more than me financially (though I’m by no means rich) and rarely gets to eat out or relax. So when she comes over I try to pamper her a little – I’ll get her favorite snacks &amp; drinks, cook for her, and usually pick up the tab if we go to a restaurant. I’ve always thought I was being quite hospitable, sometimes to the point of me even being a bit resentful of how much I give. Our relationship has become more and more “come to my house when you need a break from your life, and I’ll make sure it’s like a little vacation for you.”\n\nSo earlier this week she came over and stayed for 2 days. The first day I made us omelets &amp; toast for breakfast, and then we had lasagna for lunch and watched a movie. I made popcorn and offered her a cookie, which she declined. For dinner we went out (I paid, just as a note) and had pizza and salad. Next day, neither of us had much for breakfast. She had a cookie and I had a few bites of cold pasta salad. Then we went and played tennis &amp; went to a late lunch at about 3 pm. Keep in mind we had barely eaten and had been active. So I scarfed down my soup and sandwich, while she ate less than half of hers. I made (what I thought was) a light-hearted comment, just saying how she wasn’t eating much and had to be hungry by now. She said she was “stuffed” and “felt sick at how full she was”, which I then laughed at because, again, it was way past lunch time and we had been quite active. I just thought it was a bit funny that a few bites of sandwich and half a bowl of soup had her “so stuffed”.\n\nSo then she starts going on about how I’m always eating, that people need less food than you think, that how much she ate is more than enough for a meal, that she thinks it’s gross when people eat too much, that it’s “way too much” to eat three full meals a day, etc. It basically came across as her calling me a glutton.\n\nFor reference, though I’m not teeny tiny, I’m a normal-sized woman with no weight issues (IMO I guess). I’m tall and about a size 8. She’s probably in the 10-12 range, not “big” by any means, but noticeably bigger than me, particularly around the middle. So I just said as much: “If I overeat then why am I a little smaller than you?” She just stared at me for a second and replied “I just think you have a faster metabolism.” I just said okay and moved on, but the whole exchange continues to bother me. I don’t know which one of us was rude or if we both were or if I \\*am\\* a glutton, if I’ve been wrong to “constantly” offer her food while she’s over… IDK here. I just know that I’ve somehow ended up feeling wrong for cooking so much for her and taking her out to eat. No one likes to be told they eat too much, especially a woman, and no woman wants to hear she’s the bigger one either (which is what I told my friend). And I know I technically \"started it\" by asking her how she could possibly be full.\n\nAITA?",

As it always took me time to get to these subjects in the past, I wasn't too worried about getting there in the near future. She has a friend (let's call him M), with whom she was flirting around jokingly, but I never gave this real attention, as M is in a relationship, and I also like to flirt casually with some of my female friends.\n\nLast weekend, she went on a school trip with some of our classmates, including M.

I send them many birthday memes and other stuff just to let them know that someone is glad they were born today and are a part of my life. If I get to see them, I buy them a cake with a card and try to take them to dinner or make them dinner. I try to make the day special for them. I guess I set myself up. I sound selfish but I would even be happy with just a cake. The last two years my parents and four other siblings (I unfortunately still live with my parents) forgot. My siblings would say happy birthday and that would be it. My parents would forget and then say “Sorry, I forgot to buy a cake” and go back to watching tv. I’ve had cereal as my birthday dinner the last two years. My siblings don’t think anything of it because they thought my mother was the one who bought the cake and card for them, not realizing it has been me for the past several years since I could work and have money. I’ve stopped letting other family members put their names on the cards I buy now. I hate sounding like a brat but even if I just got a cake, I’d be happy. I just want someone else to be glad I was born and am here. My fiancé sleeps in the same bed with me and he forgot(long story why we are living with my parents for two months till we move out to our own place) his sister told me happy b-day before him and he still hasn’t said it. But would I be an asshole for telling everyone about this if they have all forgot again? Am I just being a child? Is it my own fault because I do too much for others even if they won’t return the action? I want to say screw it and not do anything else for others just I don’t want anyone else to feel the way I do on my birthday. Am I just being a asshole?",

We chilled until her parents got back home, and we were planning to have dinner on her way home. She watched funny videos on Facebook while I played a video game. Anyway, I was starving that point and my mood wasn't a hundred a percent. Her parents texted us that they are home already so we decided to get ready and go there too.

She was signaling me to come help her and I was pissed of course because i was starving already and it's such a simple task to do. So i went upstairs angrily, grabbed the keys from her hand, and accidentally bumped her with my left shoulder when i faced the door. Now, i was pissed but i didnt mean to hit her with my body. Then i proceeded to slightly angrily close the door in front of her and told her that it was that easy. So i headed down first and she followed, but she didnt ride with me and told me that she'll take the bus instead.

Me and my dad normally have quite a good relationship, but I felt really sourly towards him after this scenario and have a few times in my life, really resented him. In contrast, the relationship I have with my mum is fantastic and we rarely disagree on anything.\n\nSo, to the story: I have just dropped my girlfriend with her parents so that we can both have the day with our respective families. I get back to our holiday home and ask if anyone needs help preparing for our family lunch. Only little help is needed and my two siblings and grandmother are already sitting at the table, and there is still quite a while before lunch is served. I take a seat at the head of the table as to not have my back to the kitchen, where people are cooking, but still able to be involved in conversation. We chat for about an hour before lunch is beginning to be laid out on the table.\n\nMy father was responsible for the barbecue (we live in New Zealand, so it is summer time, and a relatively overcast day). As he puts the barbecued food on the table he asks relatively politely if I can move so that he can sit where I am. I ask politely in return why he wants to sit here. He answers by saying again that is where he would like to sit, so I say no, with my rationale being that his reasoning is simply the same as my reasoning to be sitting in this spot, plus I have the added reasoning being that I am already in said seat.\n\nHe goes to get something from the kitchen for the table and comes back and states that if I do not move he will be very angry with me, to which I reply that if I cannot sit here, then I will simply leave. My dad then goes into the garage to do something which I do not know. In the mean time the rest of my family convinces me to move seats, and we go on with our Day.\n\nFurther backstory and my current thoughts: 1st: at our holiday home there are not the kind of allocated seating plans that we have at home where each person sits at the same place when having a family meal. Plus, there were guests which normally throws all prior seating normalities out the window. 2nd: I don’t like doing things simply because someone says so. 3rd: I don’t like how in the end, the burden had fallen to me to be the one to be the grown up and move when he was the one causing the fuss. 4th: the only seat left was next to my mum (his wife) and if it were me I’d much rather sit next to my SO than at the head of the table\n\nTrying to view from my dads side: I am finding it difficult to view from his side (hence the post). But if I were to speculate the most reasonable cause for him wanting me to move was because it is his house and should be able to sit where he wants. If I go into less reasonable reasons, it could be some weird power move or some bull hierarchical subconscious thing, where he wouldn’t feel like a man if is son were at the head of the table.\n\nSorry for the long post but I am really struggling with this one and kinda need an unbiased third party at this point for my own sanity. Also, I know that I am probably biased towards my own point of view, but am having a hard time getting over that for this specific case.\n\nTL;DR: my dad asked me to move from the head of the table which I had been sitting at for an hour, I said no, he got upset, I moved when my family convinced me, when dad left the room",

		"story": "Okay so this year my boyfriend bought a house and we moved in together. We worked really hard to renovate and make it our own, but found money to be tight with all the renovations and new bills/expenses. We have an extra room and bathroom, so we decided to rent it out and get a roommate! This has helped tremendously when it comes to finances and we don’t mind sharing our space.\n\nWe posted online and found someone quickly. Now, we are not the most tidy people, and we specified this very clearly in our post. Our house is not a pigsty (The house actually had a really bad roach infestation when we bought it, and we worked really hard and spent a lot of money to fix the issue... so we wouldn’t do anything that might ruin that) but there is some clutter and sometimes we leave dishes in the sink for a day or two before washing them. We don’t use many so they take a while to pile up. Anyway, we find a roommate, and she says she’s fine with us being a little messy. She’s a really nice girl and we welcome her, give her a bed, and help her settle in.\n\nA few weeks go by and I’ll admit, we let the kitchen get messier than usual. Suddenly I get a text from my boyfriend that Roommate had texted him (From in our house, where I also was. Don’t know why she didn’t just talk to me) saying that the dishes are starting to bother her and she would appreciate if we could keep up with them a little better, as she’s been keeping her room and bathroom clean and taking care of all of her dishes. I felt really bad and immediately went to the kitchen and helped her clean up while apologizing. She explained that she didn’t want to come off rude, but it was bothering her because now that she has “her own place” she feels like it’s different because it’s “her space” and wants it to stay clean because what if she has friends over? Fair enough. \n\nWe didn’t let it get to that point again. We would have a couple dishes in the sink at a time, but would always clean up before it became a “mess”. Yet lately we have come home to her cleaning our stuff and while making small talk, she would describe how she’s SO tired from work but the mess is just killing her so she’s cleaning it anyway. And telling us about how she cleaned all the dishes and wiped all the counters and organized the shoes by the front door (she seems to have an obsession with the shoes lol). It comes off pretty passive aggressive, like we’re assholes for making her do it. I mean, she’s welcome to clean if she wants the place clean, but I feel like we made it extremely clear before she moved in that we are not super neat and tidy people. Yet it seems like she expects us to keep the place neat and tidy for her at all times. She “confronted” us about it again the other day and I just apologized and cleaned the place up. But like, am I crazy? She’s still a nice girl, but I’m starting to dread running into her at home because I don’t want to hear it. My boyfriend is equally annoyed. Are we the assholes here?",

But hear me out here, I'm starting from the beginning.\n\nI'm really hyped about candy and always get my candy from sorta fancy gourmet shops, and it's pretty expensive to me.\n\nSo one week (this happened just about last week) I bought fancy cotton candy, which costed me about $7.50, and for someone with no real income, this was a real treat.\n\nThere was actually a sale, buy 2 get 1 free, so i spent 15 bucks for 3 tubs of cotton candy. (These tubs weren't huge, they were about the size of soup containers)\n\nI show up to school boasting my pretty cotton candy, and occasionally enjoying some until 3rd period comes along. \n\nIn this class, I sit with 3 of my friends, and another girl who is the girl whose stuff got cut up.\nI share some cotton candy with them, and all is well and I put it away for a moment.\n\nI bring it back because one of my really good friends is pleading for more cotton candy (it was her favorite kind of candy and I owe her one for a favor she did for me), so I roll it across the table for her to just take a handful out of the tub and roll it back.\n\nAnd I audibly say that 'here, FRIEND, just take some.'\n\n Then, while I slowly roll it across the table, the girl snatches it off the table and takes a big handful (about 1/4 of the tub) and eats it in my face. My friend takes some and NOBODY seems to question it. \n\nI ask her why she took my cotton candy, and she just calls it 'taxes', and stares at me with a death glare.\n\nI'm just so spineless, that I don't say anything about it. Who's gonna stand up for me? It was just cotton candy, I could always get more...\n\nBut I was just so appalled at her, it was like when people would take your stuff in a joking way, and you didn't really expect them to actually take it and pass it off as a joke.\n\nSo I got to work and pulled some scissors out of my bag. We were supposed to sketch objects that we could disassemble from home, and she brought a small cheese grater cylinder, which came with a small thing cardboard box. I started cutting it up right in front of her, and I SWEAR I saw here just look at me and say nothing.\n\nEventually, she looks around, and then stares at me cutting up her box with an audible gasp, making all my friends turn and look at me.\n\n\"What the heck, why are you cutting my box?\"\nMe: idk, why did you take my cotton candy?\nGirl: it was just a joke, chill! Fix my box, I really need it!\n\nThen I proceed to tape the box back together and she gives me death glares. \n\nShe gets even hissier when I don't share any other cotton candy that I've brought in this week.\n\nBut was I an asshole for cutting up her stuff? She took my stuff, and I even fixed the box, but my friends call me selfish and stingy :(",

I was very excited and couldn't wait to get back home to see him and possibly start a romantic relationship. He kept talking about how he couldn't wait for me to get back, how we'd hang out right away, etc etc. I was definitely not picking up signs wrong here, he was very clear.\n\nWhen I actually got back home from college, and messaged him ,he was evasive.

I was driving myself insane wondering what I'd done wrong between then and now to make him change his mind so drastically.\n\nA few months later, I come to learn through the grapevine that sometime between when he started messaging me last year and when I actually came back, he met another very pretty girl and started pursuing her. They are now officially together and have been for like 6 months.\n\nI'm not going to lie, I felt misled and very hurt and rejected. While he did clearly choose this girl over me, me and him had never officially dated or even kissed so it's not like I had any sort of \"claim\" over him or real justification to be mad. I just felt stupid for being so mad over it and didn't want to interact with him anymore. \n\nI think he knows what he did as he tried to set me up with his friend which didn't work out, but that just insulted me even more that he'd basically shove me over to his friend like that.\n\nNow, about a year after he started messaging me and i left college, he is trying to hang out again, solely as friends. (he is still with the same girl.) I really don't want to, and not only that, I don't want to talk to him at all anymore. He keeps messaging me, not knowing why I don't want to see him or talk to him. It almost feels like nice karma to me because that's how I felt last year, messaging him like a clueless idiot. \n\nI don't feel I owe him an explanation and I don't want to hang out with him anymore.

There is also a pretty good chance that he will be going to jail in the next few months for his 2nd DUI, a hit and run, and drug possession.\n\nHe also found a new GF and is moving out of their apt. She can't afford the rent because he was very controlling of her and wouldn't let her work and wouldn't pay to get her car fixed so she could go and get a job.

She lost her job with the Department of Child Services for performance issues that were caused by her starting to use Meth. The meth use stemmed from the guy she was dating prior to this boyfriend. He was a drug dealer and eventually OD'd. She claimed that the stress from him dying is what lead her to try Meth as a way to cope.\n\nThere is a bigger story at play.

In the least virtue-signaling way possible, I am a self described feminist and a liberal. \n\nThat being said, I hate it when my friend(s) say that they hate men, as I am a man myself. Something about it rubs me the wrong way. I know deep down they are not talking about me, but whether I like it or not being a man is part of my identity. And when they say that, even if in their mind they aren't calling me a bad person, they are attacking part of my identity. \n\nThis is something common in my friend group; a lot of the women will use phrases like \"men are the worst, men are ____, I hate men\". It's taken as a joke, and I didn't let them know it bothered me until recently. One of the worst offenders sent a message to our group chat about a guy she had a gripe with, and in her text, she explained something she did by saying \"or maybe it's just because I hate men\".\n\nThis was the straw that broke the camel's back, and I messaged her privately telling her how I felt: that while I realized she wasn't talking about me it made me feel uncomfortable having group conversations with her, especially because she knew I was present. \nShe responded by saying that if I wasn't a bad man, than she wasn't talking about me. She also said that because I find it offensive I'm probably doing something bad she doesn't know about. (Not entirely sure what the implication is there, but I didn't like it regardless). \n\nI responded by asking if she wouldnt mind it if I said \"I hate mexicans\" or \"I hate women\" (of which she is both).  She said that it's different, because there aren't a majority group of mexicans or women who deserve that hate, unlike men apparently.\n\nSide note: as I am writing this I know it sounds like rage bait, but I really just want to know if I am being too sensitive. She is a good person overall, but I feel like this is something she got wrong and I need some outside parties to set the record straight.\n\nSo, AITA? She seems to think so, as she told some of our mutual friends and they are telling me I'm taking it too seriously, and that what I said about women and mexicans would be completely unwarranted.\n\n",

She unfortunately has fibromyalgia, which makes many things, including working, more difficult for her. She has struggled in the past to find jobs due to anxiety, including seeing a counselor about it.\n\nI work for a medical laboratory that offers good benefits and above average pay.

My wife and I had discussed in the past me going back to school, however through much consideration I decided it makes much more financial sense for me to stay in my current position, given I will not accrue any student loan debts and I also stand to make nearly as much as I would with a degree in my current position as I would with a degree. \n\nSo today, she brought up me going to school again. I told her that it didn’t make sense and she should consider looking for a new job.

I told her that she could find a job that is less stressful and less physically demanding than childcare that would also pay her more and give her benefits.

She maintains I should be the one to make changes because she is incapable and I don’t understand her condition.

During our relationship when we got mad at each other she would breakup with me and start dating another guy, and then that would make me jealous and when we got back she would say it was just to make me jealous. Now at the end of our relationship, when we were still dating, she would take longer to answer my messages than usual, wouldn't want to be with me that much and would always be with my friends (who I introduced to her as she was too shy to introduce herself). About a week and a half ago, last last Friday (before the last one) she broke up with me saying that she didn't love me anymore. I was sad but still hoped we could get back together for the first days, until I decided I was always the one trying to get things to work while she didn't care, so I didn't talk to her for 2 days and on each day she sent me a message, the first one saying \"wow, you survived a whole day without me, congrats\" and the next one was a middle finger emoji. One week after our breakup she started dating a friend of mine, one of the two I introduced her, and he was telling me how sorry he was and that he was sad for me. That just made me become even more sad than I already was and told the both of them I wouldn't talk to either for some time until I was feeling better, with my friend answering with a \"I respect and understand your choice\" and a \"cool\" from my ex. Sometime later my other friend who I introduced to her (actually reintroduced as I met her when I was with him, they also had dated for a day but that was pretty meaningless) told me she had called him two days after my breakup with her and said she had to do a truth or dare and stripped naked with her cam on covering only her private parts, and asked him to tell her what to do, what poses and other stuff. He was pretty confused but went on with it and eventually told her to show her ass and she asked \"with or without the panties\" which my friend answered with \"with\" because he said that would be too much (don't forget that 5 days later she started to date my other friend). During our relationship we had sent nudes to one another and our relationship was already a very long one, so I was weirded out about how easily she forgot me and started dating my friend, with whom she already probably already sent nudes too, I say probably because she sent a message to my friend that she and my other friend did some naughty stuff in a call.\n\nSo, am I wrong for thinking that this is too much? I mean, we dated for 2 YEARS and she just forgot me in a week and is already sending nudes to another guy, who is my own friend! And she even called my other friend and did what I just mentioned before. Also, some guy (one of the guys who she dated to make me jealous) came to me and told me she was asking for him to take photos of him with just his shorts, which I didnt believe because I didn't thought she would do such thing (now I do), and he also told me to be careful about her. Am I an asshole for thinking that this was too much? Or do I have nothing to do with what she does when she isn't dating me, even if then we got back to dating?

Bf doesn't really like animals but he's always been good with her whenever he's at my apartment and I was never uncomfortable.  \n\nThis is relevant because of a conversation we had tonight that will probably end with me breaking up with him.

One of the dishes was dog, and he knowingly tried it since he was \"curious\", and he said it tasted good.  He even said that he was the only American at the table who tried it, and that the rest of his friends were disgusted while the Chinese students laughed.  After he told me this, there was an awkward silence for a while after.  He could tell I was uncomfortable, and said that he probably wouldn't eat it again and that the yulin dog festival is cruel, but that it's not that big of a deal and it's a cultural difference.  At that point I was still in shock and barely responded.  We were both done with our food, or at least he was: I had no appetite left.  We went up to the front of the restaurant and paid the check.  We were going to see a movie but I asked him to just take me home.  I told him that I'd see him later but got out of the car before he could kiss me.  I've spent the last few hours sitting on my couch clinging onto my dog and crying.  I couldn't believe that I had let someone who had eaten dog near my dog, and I was repulsed at the idea of seeing him anymore.  I haven't said anything to my bf ever since I got out of the car but I really want to break up with him.  I'm really sad because I thought he was the best guy I've ever dated and I really felt a strong connection to him before tonight, but I can't look at him the same.  I also would never feel comfortable letting him anywhere near my sweet little girl.\n\nAITA for planning on breaking up with my boyfriend over him knowingly eating dog meat?",

We both contribute but my boyfriend manages it more frequently than I do.\n\nI work for a software company, and make a good amount as I’m mid to high level. I also was blessed enough to inherit a large sum of money from my grandmother. I contribute around 70% to the account as I make more and also have the inheritance to help us out in that regard. \n\nMy boyfriend works at a restaurant and makes a little above minimum wage there. He contributes whenever he’s able, sometimes he’ll miss a month or two at the most but it’s not a big deal overall.\n\nNow we’ve been kind of having a lot of arguments about our joint account recently, specifically the “work” department. We’re having a fancy dinner at my job in a week to celebrate the good year we had, the boss is requiring us to actually look fancy as we usually wear very casual outfits to work.\n\nThe only pair of heels I had were old and basically broken because the glue wouldn’t stick anymore. So I decided to buy a new pair for work, I went to Nordstrom, it’s a more upscale store but has some affordable options as well. \n\nI ended up purchasing heels that costed around $130. I was thrilled, upon returning home I excitedly showed my boyfriend. \n\nThe conversation below isn’t word for word but it’s to the best of my knowledge:\n\nMe: Look at these heels I got, they were really cheap too. I was stuck between this one and this other pair but I just went with this because it’s all black.\n\nBf: How much were they?\n\nMe: Originally they were $250 but it was on sale for $130.\n\nBf: That’s not much of a deal, it’s probably like $20 tops and they just overprice it because people like the brand so much.\n\nMe: I don’t even know brands, I just chose it because it looks nice and feels comfy.\n\nBf: Well I’m sure there were other alternatives too.\n\nMe: I charged it to the joint account card by the way, just wanted to let you know before you get the notification on your phone.\n\nBf: Wait what? Why would you charge it to that?\n\nMe: It’s for work, I’m planning on using them for other events in the future too.\n\nBf: Thats obviously not for work, I’m not buying Jordan’s and saying it’s for work.\n\nMe: I don’t ever wear heels, they are for work. I wouldn’t buy them otherwise.\n\nBf: If you don’t even wear any then why would you go all out like that? I hope you plan on repaying the account later on.\n\nMe: You can’t be serious, it’s $130, that’s so much hassle to transfer.\n\nBoyfriend storms out at this point, he usually needs to smoke a joint after arguments so he doesn’t get too upset. \n\nI didn’t make my case yet but I plan on bringing it up again soon. My point is the heels are a work expense, and they weren’t that expensive.\n\nHe spends over $300 a week on weed for work, which I understand it’s a part of the restaurant culture and it’s a stressful job. But that being a work expense qualifies my shoes to be as well. \n\nWhat do you think? Should I bring up my points or apologize for my mistakes?

She has had him since he was a pup and treats this dog like her child, wraps him in blankets, lets him sit at the table etc. I personally dislike this dog because he is not well behaved and constantly jumps on me and scratches up my legs. But I know that’s not his fault, it’s the owners fault for allowing it and at this point he’s too old to change.  I don’t think this older dog will take well to a younger dog coming in and stealing attention away. This older dog is also on meds for anxiety. \n\nSecondly, my friend has weird work hours as does her boyfriend which are not able to be adjusted (from what she tells me her boss is a dick). It’s not abnormal for them to leave the house at 6am and not be home until 6:30pm or later. This is okay for the older dog because they leave food and water out for him and he can eat when he pleases. However, for a 3 year old husky it seems unfair to either cage the dog for several hours or restrain him to a certain room without food or water. \n\nSo it just seems like while they have good intentions it wouldn’t be fair to either dog if they were to adopt this husky. It’s likely to put a lot of undue stress on her older dog, why not let him live out his last years in peace? It also doesn’t seem fair to the husky coming into a home where he will always be #2 and likely won’t get the exercise his breed typically requires. Should I tell her all of this? I’ve tested the waters and said something like “just make sure you’ve thought it through” and she kinda snapped at me saying “if we hadn’t thought it through do you think we’d even be discussing this?” So, what do you guys think?

Since then we have had two sets of Joy-Cons, and the left joysticks of both of them have started drifting (meaning they input things when you don't touch them etc.), which makes it pretty difficult to play certain games I like.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI (16M) have decided to use some of my birthday money to buy myself a Pro Controller. When I shared this idea with my dad to order it online, my younger brother (11M) came up to me and asked if he would be allowed to use it as well. I said no because I bought it with my own money and he could get one himself with his money, or get a HORIPAD if he didn't want to spend €68. He complained and said: \"I do with my money what I want!\" which I have learned to mean \"I'm gonna use your stuff instead so I can spend mine on Fortnite.\" I know this because he has done it in the past, such as when he lost his phone charger and kept on using mine, while our parents got him VBucks and a Battle Pass that same week.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm also pretty paranoid on letting him use it since I kinda feel he might break it. He's dropped the switch multiple times and has been known to rage pretty often when losing, even having thrown the joycons once (granted, they fell on the carpet). He claims the first joycon started drifting after our cat pushed the Switch down our table, which sounds believable, but the second one started drifting after he took the Switch to a sleepover with one of his friends. I know correlation =/= causation but I really don't want to take too many risks with something I paid almost €70 for.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne of his arguments is that I sometimes use his headphones, but I asked him whether I could use those and he said yes. If he were to say I'm no longer allowed to use it then I won't, simple as that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI mostly want the Pro Controller to play Super Smash Bros Ultimate. I also bought a Switch Online subscription to play the game online, but with a drifting joy-con that's pretty much impossible (my GSP with Lucina dropped from over 4,000,000 to 1,700,000 before I quit). It's also the main reason I wanted a Pro Controller, else the subscription would be wasted money. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy brother has since been annoying me because he'll only be able to play with the drifting joy-cons and thus basically cannot use the system. A little nuance I'm adding here is that he literally only used it to play Fortnite anymore, which he can also play on our laptop, and watch YouTube videos, which he can also do with drifting joy-cons. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe's already told our mom about it and she brought it up at the dinner table, insisting I let my brother use it from time to time as well.

Of course I don’t mean to make excuses for her abuser and it was abhorrent what she did, but it should be noted that she was severely mentally ill, suffering from disassociation, mania and depression among other things. My friend to this day still claims to suffer from the trauma of the events. As a result it was argued by some at the time that she was not as culpable for her actions. At the time I disagreed with this and besides she denied what she had done and didn’t seem to hold much remorse.\n\nFast forward to now, this girl has become seemingly quite a lot more mentally healthy and has been with a therapist since that time. She has changed, at least from what I can see, into a different, far better person. I truly believe she has changed.\n\nI have started talking to this girl and believe there may be some romantic possibilities for us, however I am aware that this would be detrimental for my friend who was abused who I still care about a lot and who has a great deal of trust in me. As a result I’m trying to make sure she would never find out and so my relationship would never affect her. However, her boyfriend who is also my friend knows and this has created a situation of having to keep this from her because he knows the revelation would cause a lot of emotion damage.\n\nSo AITA for trying to date my friends past abuser if I truly believe she has changed. And if I will do everything it takes to prevent it from hurting my friend who was abused.",

I haven’t had any time of relax lately because of final projects, papers and presentations all adding up for the last couple of weeks. \n\nThis morning I woke up feeling run down and mentally exhausted. I let my mom know how I’m feeling. Some guy comes to fix something in the house and my dogs go nuts every time someone comes over, so I had to try and keep them quiet so my mom could talk to him. This wastes my entire morning because I couldn’t leave the room to go shower or eat without my dogs destroying the door. \n\nFinally, when the guy leaves I’m able to go to the kitchen to make food. I’m on a diet so I weigh out all my stuff and get it cooking. Then my mom asks me to triple it and make it for dinner. I tell her that everything is already half way cooked and I don’t have the energy to make it again for everyone plus a separate dinner for myself because I don’t want to eat the same thing, so I offered to make something simpler for dinner.\n\nShe said it’s not fair I get a nice lunch and they don’t get to eat that too. I said they have the option to, I just don’t wanna make it for them. This blows up and I get frustrated and start crying. \n\nLater on my mom keeps talking to my dogs telling them not to be scared of me and I ask why they would be scared and she says because  I’m being an incredibly negative person.

It is even sometimes to where after we have sex, she'll come back and say stuff like \"I felt a ripe one on your back let me get it!\"  So even though I dislike it and she knows I don't like it, I have let her do it all this time because it was just one pimple or zit here and there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow over the past few weeks things have changed. I've started taking a new medication that is causing pretty bad breakouts on my back and shoulders. At first I was letting her pop some of the pimples but the breakouts got to a point where they are getting to where I am bothered by how bad they are and am trying different things to lessen the severity of them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow that I am trying to get these breakouts under control I've decided that I don't want her to pop them any longer. Not to punish her, (which she says it feels like I am doing) but because I really don't think her popping them all is doing me any good. It's my body I should get to decide whether or not she can pop them and if I want to deal with the pain and discomfort that comes with the popping.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe acts as if I am taking something away from her. It is a compulsive, almost OCD type thing with her where she REALLY wants to pop all of the pimples on my back and when I tell her no, for the aforementioned reasons, she gets offended and angry and pissed off at me. We ended up getting in a huge fight over this all because I told her I didn't want her to pop my pimples anymore. She claims that all relationships have sacrifices and this is something I should sacrifice for her because she enjoys it. She says it isn't her fault that I am breaking out, but it is because of my medicine, which is true. But I still don't think popping them and leaving red scabs on the top of every pimple/zit/blackhead that appears is making it any better.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand it is a compulsion for her and I used to let her do it, but I am at the point where I really don't want to put up with it anymore and am putting my foot down. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: AITA for telling my GF that I don't want her to pop my pimples anymore, even though it was something I used to let her do?",

We drank a lot at his place, and around 1-1:30am, walked the 10minute walk to town to see the scene at the local bars and check em out and drink a lil bit more. It was a fun night overall up til this point. We were shooting the shit and enjoying each other's company, enjoying intellectual conversation as well as pretty silly dumb conversation. The drunken walk there was front-loaded with lots of walking, then we entered the busier, partier, college-partier side of town...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBasically all I remember was as we approached one of the livelier bars, there was a group of three guys exiting. So here's what I remember happening: one of the guys closest to me punches me in the face... it wasn't hard, but enough for me to be shook up and react. So, he keeps walking on with his buds. I basically look back and decide: should I retaliate or should I ignore? I retaliate. I go up to him, throw him to the ground (he was bigger than me for sure) and I basically stomp on his face with my foot three times and there's blood. His friend comes up and says \"why are you hitting my friend?!\" I reply \"he hit me first!!\" and then I realize that I'm in the middle of the street and I'm pretty much bloodying this guy up and he is unable to defend himself and was probably just a drunk dumbass and I feel vulnerable so I leave immediately. I notice cops rolled up and there's a commotion, but I'm out of there pretty soon after.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLooking back, I can't tell if the guy actually meant to smack me in the face with a closed fist, or whether he inadvertently smacked me. I felt my reaction was definitely strong compared to what I was dealt, however I did feel the desire to \"not let him get away with it\" so that's why I reacted. The guy was bigger than me and I felt like he could pick on others if he got away with it. Looking back, reflecting more... it could have all been a misunderstanding...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I tell this story to friends the reaction is usually hugely negative against me. Mind you, most of my friends are hippie dippy types who believe in all sorts of moral superiority and I don't know if they represent the population accurately.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I come to you, AITA... obviously this wasn't a good situation, and I'm perplexed, why do many people think IATA in this situation when I tell the story...

		"story": "\nI realize that the title of this seems pretty straightforward that I would be the asshole and maybe I am but I am hoping to see what some of you think given the situation below. \n\nI have 3 boys ages 4,4, and 1 and they are central in my life along with my wife. For example in the last year I went golfing 4 times with friends of mine and I went to a couple bon fires for drinks on two occasions and that is the extent of leisure time away from my wife and kids. I'm not that guy that is more concerned with my social life outside of my family. I do everything I can to worry about them first and I just try to be as selfless as possible. With that said, I feel myself failing in other ways which ultimately makes me nervous that I will fail in the examples that I want my kids to see. I am generally lazy for the most part. I mean, I keep my lawn cut and tidy but I don’t have a lot of ambition to do much else. Like putting up Christmas lights is a big ask for me for example or finishing a room in our basement you can just forget about that. I am out of shape and gaining weight as the stress of parenting picks up. \n\nAnyway, I want to be a better person and I want to change my life so that I am a better husband and father. That is where this Peru trip comes in. My cousin asked me if I would be interested in traveling to Peru and seeing Machu Picchu. That place is in the top 10 places I would like to see before I die but my wife simply has no interest in going there. So, I asked her and she laughed at me at first until she realized I was serious and then she got mad. She views it as a vacation and I view it more like a starting point on my journey to be a better person. After all, I would have to get into better shape in order to climb up the mountain to see it so it would take months of exercise for me to get to that point. Not to mention, I don’t really have any friends that I do anything with and I see a trip like that as a healthy thing. Money really isn’t much of an issue. \n\nOn top of that all, I think I am depressed which doesn’t really make sense because I have 3 amazing kids and an amazing wife but It just feels like I am in a rut. I know it sounds crazy that the way I am wanting to fix that is flying off to Peru to climb in the mountains but the chance presented itself and generally speaking the mantra I live by is that things happen for a reason. The more I think about a trip like this the more I think it could be a really good thing for not just me but my kids and wife as well. Almost like a therapeutic journey. I want to be an example for my kids to look up to and revere and I want my wife to be proud that she is married to me. Currently, I am not so sure I am totally succeeding in that goal.  \n\nSo WIBTA if I took a trip like this in an attempt to change my life for the betterment of my family? Would it change if the trip was to somewhere much closer by? Or Is just taking a trip like that period too selfish of a thing to do and I should look for other ways to better myself instead of leaving my poor wife for a week with three kids to take care of?\n\nThanks everyone!\n",

We all hang out together (whenever we manage) and we all have fun together.\n\nSome time ago our friend in the group invited us to a house party at her place. She said it was a \"dark/leather-themed\" party so we needed to dress accordingly. Neither me or my girlfriend had any leather clothing so we had to go shopping. She suggested we go separately and just find out what we got at the party, it sounded fun so I agreed. At that time I had been hitting the gym for a little short of a year, I started showing some results and I was happy about my body (I was starting to show some noticeable muscles, so to speak). Anyways, I went shopping and I bought some cheap leather pants (I mean, I didn't think I was gonna wear them in any other occasion) and a dark sleeveless jacket to go with it. I had a black t-shirt to put under the jacket at home, so I figured I was done.\n\nSo, the night of the party comes, it was summer, it was pretty hot and my clothes really seemed heavy on me, so I decided to change the black shirt for a white undershirt to put under the jacket. I get a message from my gf that she was going out and I followed suit. I get outside of my friend's place and I see her wearing a nice dark dress and some leather boots. I told her she looked very nice, but upon seeing me her reaction wasn't as good as mine. She asked me if I thought what I was wearing was appropriate, and I said that it was, since it was a dark/leather themed party and I had leather clothings on me. She said that that's not what she meant and she stormed in. I didn't know what to make of it, so I just got in as well and started greeting all my friends. Right away I noticed that everyone was wearing something made out of leather and/or something dark, so I got even more confused about my gf's reaction. But then everyone started pointing out and complimenting my abs pressed upon my undershirt. The boys were teasing me about \"all the pussy I could get\", and some girls were just plain feeling my chest and abs. I didn't think the touching was appropriate, so I just laughed and stepped back so not to make it too awkward. \n\nI realized at that moment that the undershirt might have been the reason for my girlfriend to be upset. So I went to her and got her aside to apologize for the undershirt and to explain to her that I wasn't trying to pull any stunt but it was simply because it was summer and the leather was already making me hot so I needed something lighter under the jacket. She snarkly replied with \"well, if you think it's appropriate then it's not a problem\". I apologized again for making her feel this way and asked her if she wanted me to go home and change, she then called me an inconsiderate asshole for going to this party \"basically topless\" and that I should go for her friends instead of keep making her uncomfortable. She got out of the party, I tried reasoning with her but she wasn't gonna talk to me and went straight home. I apologized to everyone and went home as well (it didn't seem right at that point to just stay).\n\nIn my defense, I could have just chosen the black shirt and just suffered the heat for a couple of hours, but I didn't expect that that was gonna be her reaction. And I wasn't even thinking anything weird when I chose the undershirt, I was thinking about the heat! AITA here?",

I guess I don't want to police this girl's grieving, but I think she's just being an edge-lord, and I know some people cope through humor, but I felt this comment was inappropriate and flippant.

He lived with me for 9 months total. (i lived here before he added his name to the lease) His name is still on our lease. He moved out after we broke up and is living at his parents house now.\n\nWe are the happiest we've ever been in our lives together and after trying to date other people and it not working out, we ended up talking about getting back together. However, he keeps talking about immediately getting married after and is starting to plan things out.  This includes financial planning and living situations.  \nWhen we started talking about getting back together, i told him i'd like to see him be financially stable and responsible. He had to borrow loans to get through college and the police academy and his debt is significantly higher than mine. His monthly loans are about $700. I pay the same for rent including utilities.  \n\n\nI think it's fair to say paying half rent is ideal. In the past, I've given him an opportunity to calculate what he can afford by a percentage of his paycheck every month. He decided he could not afford to pay any rent. I also asked if he could cook or clean the apartment if he couldn't afford to contribute monetarily. He did not think that was a viable option and thought it was \"slavery\" and \"controlling\". This was not my intention at all and i told him so.  \nanyway, i think it would be a cheaper/easier option for him to live with me at \\~$300-350/ month than try to find his own apartment somewhere else in Milwaukee.  \n\n\nFrom his point of view, he says he would need to make 3/4 as much income as me to be able to pay half rent. I understand this, but i have no idea how we can live together in this case.\n\nHonestly, in my mind, if you cant afford to live with me, then don't.  \nHe can't accept that. He gets angry when i disagree with him and claims that i don't really love him and awful things that I know he doesn't mean. I know hes frustrated and i just have no idea how to deal with this anymore. This has bothered me so much.   \n\n\nTLDR: My ex/bf and i are interested in living together again and he doesn't want to pay rent because of student loans.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

Until people started telling me that he was actually going to do it because he's done it before with others. Then I got really annoyed. I'll admit, I'm a nerd.

He was a pathological liar, a college drop out and lived at home with his parents. He actually told me he dropped out of the same university I was attending years earlier because of a heart condition, but eventually I found out in reality he attended a community college nearby, failed out, and continued to pretend to attend the university for 2 years after. He would \"study\" at the university library and go to fake classes. I would pay for everything. He lived in the city where I spent my summers, but during the school year I was 2 hours away in my university town.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nClues that he was cheating were everywhere. He asked me not to post any photos of him, even on Valentine's Day he was irate when he thought I took a snap of him claiming he was \"too insecure\" about the weight he had recently gained and did not want to be posted. My sister's boyfriend even saw him out on a date once and he sent me photos for proof, but my ex managed to convince me the girl was just some random friend from work and it's completely fine to go to lunch with coworkers during breaks and I was such a fucking psycho for accusing him of cheating. Lo and behold, I soon found out he had been DATING the girl in the pictures and he had been telling her I was his crazy ex that he still sometimes chilled with because he felt bad. I messaged her and warned her politely, then dumped him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward a month: I'm in the city to visit my sister and party for a weekend.

My ex begins freaking out that I'm there, yelling petty nonsense at my girlfriends who I was with, who happened to be (or were) our mutual friends screeching they should have chosen his side etc. The drama eventually subsides, and an hour later I run into one of his best friends (HF) getting drinks and I ask him if he wants to go for a smoke. I'll spare you of all the details, but it was surprisingly easy to make him want to go home with me and that's exactly what we did.

Now, this isn't the first time she has smelled tbh.  I've told her before and she gets really upset, so I go through this ridiculous performance, where I first smell myself, then ask her \"do I smell?\" which prompts her to say no, and then ask if she smells, to which I nodded.  I thought she would get changed and we would move on and the problem would be over.  Unfortunately, she didn't get changed, we went out to the town and did some shopping.  On the bus home, she raises her arm, and releases the smell, so I say \"we can wash that jumper when we get in\".  So far so good (?).  We get home and get ready to go out to the pub to watch the rugby and she's still in this jumper.  She's sitting down reading a book and is giving me one word answers to questions so I ask her if I upset her by telling her that her jumper smelled and she's giving me one word replies and then she tells me to leave it.  So I did, and went for a shower.  When I got out of the shower, there's still this atmosphere between us, so I say to her \"tell me what's upset you\" to which once again she tells me to leave it.  So I said \"no, I'm not going to go to the pub with you while there is this atmosphere, we need to clear the air\".  So she starts saying how it was embarrassing etc. and that I kept \"banging on about it\".  I said the whole situation was ridiculous, which she then decided meant I said *she* was being ridiculous, which escalated the problem further.  Earlier on, she said that she didn't have any other clothes to wear, so I said \"well we don't have to go to the pub\" to try and solve the situation, which she then took to mean that I thought she was \"too smelly to go out with\".\n\nThe thing is, I'm always telling her to have a shower, or brush her teeth, and she's 29 years old.  It's not the first time I've had to tell her to change because her clothes smell.  I don't feel like I should have to constantly tell her to shower etc.  I also feel like if I smelled, and she didn't tell me I would be pissed off at her.\n\nI probably shouldn't have said the situation was ridiculous at a time of heightened emotion, but still...I feel like it was such a ridiculous thing to argue over.\n\nAm I the Asshole??",

It's a bit pricy at $1100 a month (990 rent and utilities + 110 parking) and the building is older causing some issues, but it's big for a studio and best of all I have it all to myself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents have never been happy with how old it is, though I'm content. They also would rather my rent money be going to the family rather than a landlord and were looking to have property in the city where I go to school. The idea came up that for next year, they would purchase a condo or apartment and have me rent from them instead. We ended up finding a two bedroom.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some background. For the two years prior to this one, I had very negative roommate experiences. My roommates were incredibly selfish and hostile, to make a very long story short. Both of these situations had a profound effect on my wellbeing mental and physical even resulting in recurring nightmares.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOriginally, I had a friend who was interested in rooming with me, and I know her well enough to be certain we wouldn't have issues. Unfortunately she's since backed out and opted to live alone. Despite this, my parents are insisting I find another roommate. I feel extremely uncomfortable looking for an alternative roommate amongst my classmates or strangers because I can definitely not afford to have a bad living situation right now. As a professional student, my workload is about ten-times what it used to be. I've already been struggling a great deal so anything that can potentially add additional stress and anxiety could really send me into a real tail spin.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have explained this to my parents multiple times. My dad thinks I'm being dramatic and my mom doesn't even want to hear it. Neither of them have ever had bad roommate situations and they also come from a culture where mental health issues are hardly understood to the point of being mocked. I still haven't revealed to them I had to start seeing a therapist earlier this year for fear of how they'll react. Anyhow, they counter by saying since they're the landlords if the person does anything I can just have them evicted immediately. Personally I dread having to deal with that kind of situation, as I know it'll stress me out beyond measure. They also say I should've ensured they bought a one-bedroom or studio instead if I was so against this. However, at that time my friend was still saying she'd most likely move in with me (she never confirmed, though). They also said themselves that they didn't feel a one bedroom or under would be worth it investment wise.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs I said earlier, I have told them I will pay the price for two in spite of the extra load it'll put on me loan-wise.

This was every other day for weeks, fast forward a couple months, I’m bored as frick sitting in her class and I start to zone out, I’m staring out the floor thinking of how I’m gonna play Mario odyssey when I get home, then she yells “OP, bring it here!” “What?” “Bring it here” “What are you talking about?” “Don’t act like I don’t know you’re on your phone!” “I’m not on my phone...” She’s still resisting, I lift my backpack up off the ground, onto the table, and I unzip the pocket on the left side, reach in and pull my phone out. She still looks at me with her stupid, condescending face and waits for me to walk over to her desk. I set it on the table and reluctantly say “sorry, it won’t happen again...” Then you know what I hear? “No it won’t. Cause I’m sending you to the office” EXCUSE ME??? I made it very clear that I wasn’t on my phone and she still sends me to the office??? I rip the note out of her hand and march down to the office.

Yeah that makes sense” Then I didn’t get in trouble. I was absolutely shocked that he believed me, but it was welcome. After that I started making memes about her to make me and my friends laugh, it made her class more bearable. Then my friend gets the idea to make a meme page. I was reluctant cause I didn’t want to get in trouble, but I went through with it because it sounded like fun. The page started to gain some traction from kids that went to the school.

I moved away and we kept in touch on and off over social media. We ended up reconnecting my second year of college. She had a boyfriend at the time, but we started talking more often and were good friends. I eventually asked her out, but she said she would only hang out with me as a friend, not on a date. I was bummed, but took the chance to see her. It was fun, nothing happened though.\n\nShe started catching feelings for me later on and ended her relationship because she said she didn’t want to cheat. We started talking more seriously, but after a month I realized I wasn’t ready for something serious. She also lived a bit away and didn’t have a car, so it was a 30 to 40 minute drive for me and a hassle to see her. I told her I didn’t want us to talk anymore and didn’t really feel like explaining why, so I stopped replying to her messages asking to talk about it. When she started getting more upset, I ghosted her and we didn’t talk for six months. I realized I messed up though and asked her for another chance and to show her I was serious, that she’d be my girlfriend officially this time. She was reluctant but said yes.\n\nOne thing that she had said before we started dating was that she didn’t want to have sex before marriage and then after we got together, that she didn’t want to unless I loved her (she was a virgin at the time). I felt like that wasn’t fair because 1. she knew I wasn’t a virgin and 2. I had a high libido. I also didn’t think it was reasonable that I had to love her or that I wouldn’t be able to sleep with my girlfriend.\n\nWe dated for about a month and during this time, I actually cheated on her with another friend of mine. I eventually started feeling the same as before about the relationship, and ended up telling her it wasn’t working for me a week or two later. I didn’t ghost her this time and we talked for an hour. After a serious but calm discussion, we broke up. I told her about the cheating and we talked about our issues some more. After thinking later that day about our talk, I realized I didn’t want us to break up, and we got back together that same day. She then told me that she felt she wasn’t being fair to me before and that if I wanted to, we could have sex since she was my girlfriend after all. I was stoked and we hooked up that night. We stayed together for another month, but I started feeling like I wasn’t ready for something so serious again and just wasn’t as into the relationship anymore in general. I ended up breaking up with her. She was upset and said that she felt really used, but told me she understood. After we talked about how things were, what went wrong, and the relationship in general, we stopped talking.\n\nIt’s been a few months since then and I’ve grown a lot as a person. I’ve been doing my own thing and investing in myself, but lately I’ve started thinking about her. She was really good to me and I miss our conversations. She always let me do what I want or hang out with my friends. She never asked me to come see her, but said she really appreciated when she did get to. Overall, she was really sweet and a good girlfriend. I kind of want to ask her for another chance, but I’m afraid she might not be as open to a relationship.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA for wanting to try again (again)?",

Over the weekend, there was an event where you could catch shiny Pokémon for a limited amount of time. Shiny Pokemon are essentially the exact same as regular ones, except they're a different color [example](https://i.redd.it/a54wjs8xlv121.jpg). \n\nMy favorite Pokémon is Gengar (which is relevant info for later). My girlfriend's favorite Pokémon of all time is Bulbasaur. There is no Pokémon she loves more than Bulbasaur. During the event, she caught one of each type *except* Bulbasaur. I caught shiny after shiny and was able to get multiple of each Pokémon. I even caught two Bulbasaur. \n\nI caught my second Bulbasaur just as the weekend ended. My girlfriend was there and she was clearly distraught because the event was over and she hadn't caught one. I could tell she was sad and asked why she was sad because at least we both had caught shinies.\n\nShe then expressed her disappointment that we had played all weekend in the cold rain only for her to catch everything but her favorite and that it felt like a slap in the face. She then started crying (which is when I started getting annoyed). She said it was because I did a dance every time I caught a shiny while she was still empty-handed. My dancing was meant to be a joke and I felt it was very obvious that I was joking, but she said it felt like rubbing extra salt in the wound because this happens every time there is an event. To be fair, it's true that I always get significantly more lucky than her but RNG is the mechanic of the game. Some are luckier than others.\n\nShe then mentioned the time when there was an event for the Pokémon Gengar. On this day, she said that by the end if I wasn't able to catch a shiny, she would trade me hers even if it was the only one she had. In the midst of crying, she admitted that she didn't feel entitled to my second Bulbasaur, but that it disappointed her that she would be willing to sacrifice her single Gengar for me when I wasn't able to sacrifice one of my two Bulbasaur for her.\n\nHowever, even though I did catch a few shiny Gengar on Gengar Day, I wouldn't have felt entitled to her Gengar. Even though Bulbasaur isn't my favorite, I still wanted to keep my second one so that I could have the second evolution as well. I did not want to give it up. My annoyance was heightened by the fact that she acted so childish over a mobile game.\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole?",

Now I'm taller than the rest of my family and not as easy to push around.\n\nBefore I get into the incident at hand, I need to explain a bit of whats happened in the past. So my older sister used to bully me, in the sense that she was degrading me at every moment and basically treating my like a slave, naive me thought it was just how older siblings act. After a hell of a long time of that and many other things that aren't relevant happening she left the house at like 16 ish, I was 12 at the time. And so 3-4 years later she just magically comes back to the house with 0 prior warning as to what's going on (my dad brought her back without telling my mum who is the person who runs the house). And so 3 weeks of her constant shit and I just stop talking to her because she's a mega bitch, but at this point was the last straw.\n\nBTW: at the time of the incident she's 20, I'm 16\n\nThis point: my cousins came over to the house to visit (lovely kids, but they're young and get rowdy) and I was playing with the youngest when I see my younger sister (not mega bitch older sister) putting her foot against the older cousins back (who is still fairly young), I don't scold her but I do tell her not to do it because you don't kick people. MB (how I'll refer to older sister from now on) decides this is prime opportune to mock me for whatever reason, and after tons of her shit I just told her that nobody was talking to her and to butt out. She didn't like this and got pissed. \n\nFF to after I've helped put the kids in the car as it was getting late and they needed to go home. Before I went outside MB ran upstairs for a minute, waited until I came back inside and waited for me in the living room. My mum tells me to do something so I ignore MB's presence for now and do what she says. When I come back in MB comes up to my face and starts threatening me. Due to me not being scared of her and being taller I stood my ground as she swung at me once. I didn't retaliate straight away as I was taught to let girls swing once, but if they think they can do it again restrain them. \n\nAs I stepped back she got in my face and swung again, so I did what any sane person would do, and restrained her against the sofa, through a mixture of pushing her, using my weight against her and pulling her hair once (keeping in mind this entire time she's still attacking me). I get off her after she's no longer able to hit me and push her away. When we're both stood back up she still swings at me but I hold her arm to stop her. Of course I'm pissed at this point so I scream at her at the top of my lungs to go die or leave because I'm sick of her shit. \n\nSo she scurries off to my father's house to tell him what happened, and because she hit me multiple times before I retaliated I felt I was in the right. \n\nMy father comes home and screams at me I'm in the wrong, which is complete bullshit. \n\nSo reddit, AITA? \n\n\n",

Due to the circumstances I am unable to legally work for a couple months while we work on getting me my employment authorization document, adjustment of status, etc. I have a lot of time to myself since my husband often works long hours but I've been enjoying the time to re-immerse myself into old hobbies, volunteering, and re-decorating the house. It's very relaxed but I had a super-stressful job beforehand, and, coupled with the move, it's really nice to finally have a break.\n\nMy husband's sister has children (1.5y &amp; 3y) who are wonderful -- but who I suddenly felt expected to babysit whenever. Since I am not working currently his family seems to have the impression that I am just sleeping the days away or otherwise doing nothing -- which my husband and I have told them was not the case. A lot of times I would barely get any notice. Like maybe a text an hour or 2 before she's at my doorstep dropping off the kids. However I do not enjoy playing babysitter at all. I don't even want kids of my own and watching someone else's every other day is starting to drain me. \n\nMy husband and I talked it over and he agrees it's a bit much -- after all, watching the children cuts into our own personal time that we get together. So recently I've told his sister that, no, I wouldn't be around as an on demand babysitter anymore. Unless it was an emergency I wouldn't be available to watch her children every other day. This wasn't taken well by the family. In their view she's a struggling single mom and I'm just a lazy person who rather sit on my ass than help out family. I've put my foot down though.

I have my husband's support but I still feel really bad for making things awkward for him with his family.

		"story": "Throwaway for anonymity. Also, sorry for the long post, but I felt like a detailed timeline would be best. Anyway, here goes:\n\nI broke up with my ex after dating her for a month and a half. The reason I broke up with her at the time was because I felt like she was becoming manipulative. She had mental health issues I tried my best to help her with, but the emotional burden was getting really heavy on me especially since she would guilt trip me/threaten to self harm/threaten to kill herself if I wasn't able to satisfy her need for validation, etc. While I wanted to help, I felt like I was not in a good position to do so. \n\nWhen I broke up with her over call, it actually went pretty well and I thought we could end on good terms. An hour after the breakup, she texted me \"oh by the way, I cheated on you lol\" (almost verbatim) which made me angry as shit. Particularly because the way she said it made it sound like she didn't care and specifically tried to spite me. Turns out a few weeks into our relationship she made out with some guy at some party while drunk, and I was out of the country. \n\nI told her how angry I was, but after a few hours she messaged me again saying she didn't actually cheat on me and it was just something she made up to hurt my feelings. Why she would make something like that up is beyond me, but I told her her manipulative behavior plus her immaturity meant I didn't care if she was lying or not, I was done with her. \n\nAfter that, I tried to cut off communication. She would still message me, literally threatening to kill herself if I didn't reply, and even went to the length of sending me suicide notes and sending pictures of the building she wanted to jump off. This was super fucking alarming, but I also felt like she was trying to manipulate me into staying, so I had to tread carefully. I told her to please get professional help because I couldn't help her anymore, and then stopped replying. \n\nAfter a few weeks, she messaged me saying she got professional help because of the breakup, and she thanked me for that. I replied that I was happy for her, but stopped replying again to continue to keep distance from her. Sometime after this I found out from one of our mutual friends that she wasn't lying about cheating on me after all, so I got angry again and really didn't reply to her messages.\n\nOver the next few weeks, she would message me almost every other night, first sending me Christmas greetings which I didn't reply to. Then she got increasingly angry, she started asking if we could please talk because I was making her have anxiety attacks every night, which I still didn't reply to. She said she just wanted to know what she did wrong, which I felt like I already detailed in the breakup and after it. After a long time of this happening, I decided to just message her that I had nothing more to say and I didn't owe her anything because of how she treated me. She continued to message after this, and I decided to block her on Facebook.\n\nI hadn't heard from her in a couple of days until today, when she messaged me on Twitter (I hadn't blocked her there) and told me something. She said that she had wanted to tell me this since December, but the fact that she \"cheated on me\" wasn't the full story. She said she only found out later on that at that party where she was drunk, she didn't willingly make out with the dude but was forced into it. She only found out about this afterwards because she wasn't fully conscious that night. She said that I didn't let her tell her side of the story, and that I was making her lose sleep and fuck me for being so stubborn.\n\nI had no idea that was the case, because when she told me she just said she cheated on me. I feel terrible for her having to go through that. At the same time, I had no way of knowing the truth there because she told me a different version of it. I kind of feel like she's gonna tell her friends (in our shared friends circle) that I'm an asshole for breaking up with her and treating her like that after having to go through such a thing.

		"story": "This is a throwaway account, thanks for reading!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am in a relationship with someone I love very much, and who requires a lot of attention from me. She loves to cuddle and be held, and I stop what I am doing several times a day to hold her for a bit. She also shuts down when she’s spoken to harshly and is not the greatest at cleaning up after herself. I was a neat freak in my past life but have learned to temper my response to messiness, so we can reach compromises on how often we clean. Being in a messy home gives me anxiety, so I have had to sit myself down and get myself to accept that as long as we’re living together, I will not have full control over our space, and I cannot constantly nag her to pick up after herself.  She is also not great with time/space boundaries, and likes to be together a lot. When she is feeling bad or anxious, I sit with her and talk through what is going on, and hold her, etc. I’m a fairly independent person and do not need a lot of support, so a lot of our energy is focused on her. All of that said, she is loving, kind, generally respectful of my feelings, smart, very funny, and we share the same opinions on almost everything philosophically/socially/politically. We are pretty good at communicating, I have voiced my concerns about everything above and we’ve been working on those issues.\n\nLast night she and I had a few glasses of wine and went to bed. Once we were in bed, we started cuddling, and I put my hands in her pants and started running my fingers through her pubic hair/rubbing the hair around/generally playing with it. This wasn’t meant to be sexual, it just feels nice because she has a full bush. She asked me to stop, I did, and we went to sleep.\n\nIn the middle of the night, we woke up, and she asked me if I remembered the night before. I didn’t quite, I’d had a lot of wine (we were celebrating something). Then as she started telling me, I remembered. Both my girlfriend and I have been victims of sexual assault. I asked her if what I’d done was triggering for her. She said it was. I told her that I was very sorry, and that I would not do that again.\n\nWhen we woke up in the morning, she was still acting off. I asked her if she was still having feelings about what had happened last night. She said she was, and I told her again that I was sorry. She asked me why I did that, and I told her that I only meant to cuddle, I was not trying to initiate sex, and I was sorry. She said she understood. I again said that I was sorry, and she said it was okay, but she was silent. I asked if she wanted to speak about it more or if she’d rather speak to someone else (we are both in therapy). She didn’t say anything.\n\nWe got out of bed and she was silent and barely speaking to me. When she did speak, it was with flat affect, and she didn’t make a lot of eye contact. I figured that she was still processing the event and would talk with me when she was ready. But then she started kicking things around and just seemed generally upset. She was ready to leave for work, and I was still getting ready. I told her that she didn’t have to wait for me if she wanted to go, and she decided to stay, still angry/upset. At this point, I have to admit I became a bit frustrated. I asked her why she waited for me if she was so angry with me. She made a sort of, “are you kidding me?” look but didn’t say anything to me. I wanted very badly to leave for work without her, because we weren’t getting anywhere and also, it would have been quicker and more efficient for me to leave without her (we work about 15 minutes away from eachother in the city, she was driving, I wanted to take the subway). I told her I was going to leave separately, and she became even angrier. So I came back and we got in the car together, to have the tense, miserable car ride that I had been trying to avoid. And because she would've been late if she dropped me off first, but her work has a free parking lot and mine doesn't, she ended up dropping me off at one of the subway stops near her work anyway.\n\nI can’t tell if I’ve behaved badly or not. I am completely, 1000% behind the premise that when it comes to sex, boundaries are boundaries, full stop, no explanation needed. And because we are both survivors of assault, I am also 1000% behind the idea that she gets to decide how she reacts to an event that triggers her. If she feels like being angry, for any amount of time, after we’ve spoken about what happened, that is absolutely fine. If she *needs me to be there to receive her anger*, but not directly respond to it by continuing to ask what I can do, that’s fine as well, although I admit that’s coming up against some of my limits too. But a sexual assault trigger is a trump card in my book, so do what you need to do.\n\nMy concern is that I can feel myself saying, “fine, but this is it” in terms of coddling her in other parts of our relationship. And I’m not sure if that is a healthy way to be feeling, and I am especially suspicious because it’s coming up after I’ve been told that I made sexual advances that were unwelcome, and am having negative feelings around being treated like I’m some predator. I don’t want to be retaliatory, I absolutely want her to tell me when she’s uncomfortable and I’m glad she did. But if she says she’s uncomfortable, I stop doing what I’m doing, and apologize when it’s brought up later and ask her what she needs, then I’m not sure what else to do. I have a feeling that she wants/wanted me to cradle her in my arms, speak gently to her, and let her do whatever she wants around the house after this as far as not picking up after herself, and I am having a very strong negative reaction to that. I *know* that it is absolutely inappropriate to tell someone that they are overreacting to a sexual trigger, but I can’t help but feel like she could be using this incident as a tool to mold us into the dynamic I know she’s wanted. If I’m wrong, and what happened has really triggered some awful memory, then I absolutely should cradle and coddle her until she feels better, and I should be ashamed for getting angry at her this morning. But if she is blowing it out of proportion to get us back to an unequal relationship dynamic, then I am absolutely furious that she would stoop so low.  Am I the asshole for even asking this question?\n\nFYI we are both women, if that matters.\n\nTLDR: I massaged my girlfriend in a way that made her uncomfortable, I told her that I was sorry, but she is still very angry with me. We’ve been working on having a more equal relationship as opposed to one that is primarily focused on her, and I am worried that her reaction to this event is stemming more from the fact that she wants to be coddled than anything else.

		"story": "Tonight my boyfriend and I had planned a nice pizza and sleepover night to celebrate being together. Every month on the 3rd we usually spend time together and plan something nice. We both decided last night would be better instead as we both don't have work today. He works early shifts in the morning (had done a 6am-12pm yesterday then went to the gym after for a bit) which I understand can make him tired but he definitely gets enough sleep before work (sleeps around 10pm). It's always difficult when he gets tired as he gets moody if he stays awake but also gets annoyed if he sleeps, so either way it's not good for me, it's always difficult as I never know if I should wake him up. Tonight he ended up lying down and falling asleep around 7.30pm (we were watching Netflix together) so I finished the episode and changed it over so he wouldn't miss any more (I'm fine rewatching the episode with him). I had nothing to do so I was scrolling on my phone from around 8.30pm till 11.30ish. He woke up a few times and every time he woke up he'd huff and say sorry (for sleeping but it didn't sound like he meant it at all). Somehow we ended up arguing around 1am. I woke him up to switch sides of the bed, I also filled his water bottle up and put his phone on charge for him (didn't argue specifically because of moving), I came downstairs and lay on the sofa till 3.30am to give him space and time to calm down. When I got back upstairs, he ended up waking up again, I asked if he wanted me in bed with him and wanted to cuddle and his response to both was \"I don't care\". Recently I've spoken to him about how his attitude and the way he speaks to me makes me feel unwanted/unloved/not good enough. We ended up arguing again because he asked what was wrong so I told him that tonight felt like a bit of a waste to me because I had nothing to do and didnt really have company. I offered to go home earlier on in the night but he told me to stay, which he then threw in my face later on that I could have gone home. I explained that I wasnt annoyed with him sleeping but I was just bored and lonely which he got annoyed at and started accusing me of complaining at him to wake up and sit up (which I didn't do because I knew he would get grumpy). It's now 6 in the morning and I'm back downstairs on the sofa (again after the 2nd argument). I haven't slept yet because I always find it very difficult sleeping on an argument, he's currently asleep in his bed.\n\nI do understand he's tired and I do feel for him because I know it's not nice, but I end up getting upset because he gets so moody and becomes rude to me even when I try help. I explained that I knew he was tired but he didn't help himself by lying down as he knows it always makes him sleepy, and also said that he had enough sleep so it can't be that. He then threw it in my face that I don't \"actively exercise\" so I wouldn't understand what it's like. I feel like this was a dig at me personally, I'm not fat but I guess I am chubby, I weigh 138lbs and am 5'4\". I used to do a small home workout in my bedroom, all core activities to tone up, I haven't done it for about a year so my tummy isn't toned but I personally don't hate it- I like my body, but whenever he mentions something negative I always end up disliking it. I have an hourglassy figure and he always seems to like my body and compliments it when it suits him (like when I send pictures).\n\nThings have been rocky recently so I know that won't have helped tonight but I feel like I'm slowly losing it because I feel like I try more than enough to make things good and do little bits here and there to make him happy and help him.\n\nTldr; planned special (ish) night with boyfriend, he slept very early, woke up later and argued because I said I was bored during the night, he got annoyed at me and accused me of being annoyed at him (I explained I wasnt) I'm now on the sofa because he told me to leave him alone",

During high school I was in foster care and I faced a large amount of physical/sexual/emotional abuse from my biological parents, and H always supported me through my battles with mental disorders. Then I was kicked out of my home and my relationship with H went into a downward spiral. I very rarely saw H because she was spending so much time with her new friends from college. I confronted H, and she apologized and claimed it was because of “school” and “work” taking up a large amount of her time so her schedule was always packed. I then met my significant other, who I will call D. H never cared for D and made this fact very clear, and she screamed and yelled at me after D picked me up and I slept at his house for our one-week anniversary. She told me I needed to let someone know before I went out with boys I “didn’t know very well” because “I could end up getting in a bad situation”. I moved in with R after a month of dating and H refused to drive out to see me, even though it was only a 30-minute drive. She always had excuses saying that the “drive was too far” and that “I didn’t help pay for gas”. I told her that I would never put a monetary value on her friendship and she said that was not fair, because I wasn’t the one who had to spend money to hang out. At the time, I did not have my driver’s license or a job, so this really, really hurt. I called her a selfish bitch that cared about money more than her best friend, and she ignored this. I later apologized for my outburst. We started to talk again, but it was never quite the same because she was always hanging out with T. I went through 5 pregnancy scares, and she NEVER ONCE was there to support me through these scary times, and I told her that she was not a good friend for not supporting me through my problems.\n\nNow, D has proposed to me and I am ecstatic. I already have it planned out, and picked a MOH dress to match H. You can imagine my shock when I was given a very confident NO.

Other than that, she has driven me around only a handful of times, so overall I would guess that she has only spent $50-60 on me. I brought this up to her and she LAUGHED and said I was “proving her point that I was only focusing on myself and my own problems.” I have not spoken to her since.

However, unbeknownst to Joey, his feelings for Monica are unrequited.\n\nIn my private discussions with Monica and Joey, I've gleaned some very important details about the situation.\n\n1. Monica is aware that Joey \"probably\" has feelings for her, but they've both been very passive about discussing their relationship. She's been waiting for Joey to confess his interest in her so that she could let him down. So it looks like for better or worse, she's been stringing him along for at least four months.\n\n2. Joey has told me in no uncertain terms that he likes Monica. In fact, he's already begun to refer the two of them as a couple despite it not ever having been communicated.\n\n3. Monica has feelings for me. And damn it all, I can't conceal my emotions too well. I'm pretty sure she knows that I like her too just from how much I blush with every little hint (read: very obvious sign) she gives me.

I made it clear to him that I have feelings for Monica and that it's likely that she actually has feelings for me. His reaction has been expectedly poor, basically outright denial.\n\nI've encouraged Joey to talk to Monica about the situation, but he still hasn't, probably for fear of rejection.

I really want Joey to get the closure he needs by doing it himself, because I'm sure the whole situation is painful enough and I don't want to hurt his feelings any more than they already are.\n\nThat being said, I don't want to continue to put this part of my life on hold for the sake of Joey's feelings.

Ultimately, if you choose to pursue your feelings, be prepared for possible repercussions on all relationships involved, including your friendship with Joey."

My team members did most of the proposal before I arrived to the group, and said it was only fair that I had to do most of the final paper.\n* The week the proposal was due I was busy every day from 8am-11pm so I couldn't meet up that week, but offered to do whatever work I could. They asked me to edit their proposal, so I edited it.\n* Last week, I got sick with a flu and got pink eye, so sitting up and using my eyes was difficult. I also had two final exams last week, and 2 on this recent Tuesday. The final paper was due today at 5pm.\n* One group member said, \"get your sections to me by Monday night\" so they could have the final draft ready by the time that office hours on Tuesday. I told her that I would try my best, but that I was sick and had several finals, so it might not be the greatest draft.\n* Monday night, I've written up a rough draft. I sent it to them around 11pm with an apology and an explanation that I had to study for my other finals the next day, but I'd have the final draft ready by Wednesday.\n* Group member texted me at 2am when I was still up studying for finals. She said that she had never wanted me to join the group in the first place, that I left all the difficult parts for them, that she didn't care what was going on in my life because I had the whole weekend to work on it, that I'm a student and I should know better how to behave in a group project, that she was \"so very sorry\" for whatever was going on in my life but that I can't complain because they did the project proposal for me. She also said that I could do my own project if I couldn't keep up.\n* She responded \"ok\" to my apologies. I told her I would continue editing the paper right away, and did so. She told me \"Fine, have it done by Tuesday night then. is that good enough?\"\n* I e-mailed the professor asking if I could do the group project alone. He was curious as to why I wanted to do the project alone 3 days before the deadline, so I explained the situation. He understood and told me I could use the same concept and the same work that I had already done.\n* I texted my group members that I was doing my own project, because I couldn't work with them anymore. It was causing me a lot of distress because honestly I'm sensitive and not used to being talked to in that way. I removed most of my work from the paper and wrote my own version of the parts they had completed, and turned in my own version.\n\n\\*\\*tl;dr\\*\\* Group members presented me with an early deadline that I was unable to meet, group member was upset that I didn't get it done because of sickness/finals. I left the group and did my own project. Am I the asshole?",

My dad is pretty strict but can also be very nice to me and my siblings and he has made huge contributions for my interest in music for example, escpecially since he’s very interested in music himself. Of course I am very grateful about this. In my later teens (I’m 19m) we have built somewhat of friendship since we share alot of the same interest. He has got somewhat of a bad temper though and he is very stubborn. I could be hard to deal with when I was younger because I did alot off dumb things with my friends and I hated almost all my teachers (now I love all of my teachers). This could make him extremly angry and the occasional slap has been awarded for my missbehaviour. Nothing to traumatasing really.\n\nNow I’m in the last grade of swedish highschool and to get to the point. I was feeling sick the other night (I still am) and felt that I couldn’t go to school. As soon as I realised this I also knew my dad would be unhappy about it. He proceeded to tell me that I was being lazy and told me to go to school anyway. I’m not saying he was wrong but it kind of pissed me off (I guess I have inherited his temper). I proceeded to angrily tell him that I’m old enough to decide wether I’m well enough to go to school. I want to believe that I am humble enough to understand that I probably did not sound as mature as it seems. I went into my room, called in sick, and went to bed. He proceeded to storm into my room, calling me a spoiled middleclass brat and so on, also calling me weak. As the true millenial I am I became somewhat offended and started talking back whilst laying in my bed. He told me to shut up whilst walking out to shout at my other brother for something. Note; Telling someone to shut up in Sweden is a bit harsher than in english. Hence (the fuck). I told him ” you shut (the fuck) up” back and he turned back into my room, grabbed me by the throat while I was still laying in my bed and said something along the lines of ”don’t you ever tell me to shut the fuck up you understand me?”. I got mad and went to school because I did not want to be in the house anymore.

This came to a head five weeks ago as I recognized the pressure of the future ahead of me, and I took a hiatus from work and college and traveled around the country hiking, sightseeing, and finding ways to feel fulfilled. I ended up working at an opioid clinic helping lead recovery groups, and found myself happier than I have been in a long time. The clinic offered me a full-time job post-graduation.\n\nSo what's the issue? I am from New York, and the job is based out of Oklahoma. Further, for three years, I have been working to graduate college with my father's goal in mind: medical school. I've been accepted to four medical schools, which is exciting, but not at all how I think I want to spend my life. My dad is incredibly attached to me (and I have been attached to him, too, since I went through treatment) and breaking away from all that (especially his lofty expectations for my future) feels really good. It does not, however, feel really good to him.\n\nHe is absolutely livid, and I haven't even told him how definite the plan is yet.

He thinks I am being irresponsible and rash, and has been very clear about it. He said I am being an idiot &amp; an asshole by \"throwing away the future\" he \"built up for me.\"\n\nI just don't feel like I'm throwing anything away, because I don't even want to be a doctor. These are his dreams for me I am abandoning, and I'm developing my own goals and future in place. I feel genuinely happy about the idea of being independent and a productive, functioning member of society. I keep trying to explain this to him, but he thinks I'm being stupid and, basically, spitting in his face. \n\nI didn't think I was being an asshole, but now I feel like maybe I am?

		"story": "Some backstory: Mother-in-law (MIL) suffers from bipolar disorder and PTSD. The PTSD is from dealing with her adult son's heroin addiction and him ODing a few times. He was clean when I met and married my husband (11 years ago), but started using again roughly 2 years ago. His relapse brought out the crazy in her I had really only heard about (from my own husband) until that point.\n\nBrother-in-law (BIL) lived with MIL and my father-in-law and they would often have our 5/6 year old daughter (now 7) over to their house or take her out to do things. It made me uncomfortable, but my husband didn't see the problem so I let it be. When it became obvious that brother-in-law was not just temporarily relapsing, we made it a rule that we didn't want our daughter around him at all. He moved out to do heroin 24/7 or whatever, so it didn't seem like it was a big deal.\n\nIt all started innocently with MIL not telling us that he was at their house when we'd go to drop our daughter off. Or he would just magically be there when we would pick her up.  We gave them several chances with this, but they'd totally ignore our wishes because \"he's not high on anything right now\" etc. They finally realized that we were serious (though this was still an occasional issue) and we thought everything was fine and they'd keep daughter away from him.\n\nWell last spring, after going to the mall with MIL, my daughter says something along the lines of, \"Something weird happened and it's making my belly hurt thinking about it.\" I asked about it and she stated that on the way to the mall my MIL had stopped at a gas station to talk to BIL. Apparently MIL and BIL got into a verbal fight that ended with both cussing each other and MIL crying. She also stated that some random girl came up to the car to ask MIL if she was giving BIL money. I flipped my shit (not in front of daughter) and told my husband that I was done, his parents would no longer have our daughter alone. He thought I was overreacting, but agreed not to allow them to have her alone anymore.\n\nA few months later, husband laments that MIL didn't realize that what she did was in violation of what we wanted, etc, and asks me to give her another chance. Now MIL is known for being emotional and stuck up BIL's butt, and I don't trust her to make the right decision if BIL calls needing her while she is alone with my daughter. So I tell my husband that she can take her out to eat and to the mall on the condition that father-in-law is with them the entire time. That way, if she goes ballistic for whatever reason, there would still be one rational adult around. This maybe sounds like a stretch, but she had called my husband sobbing on Father's Day and asked him to go with her to the area hospitals to look for BIL. Why? Because he simply didn't answer her multiple phone calls. That was not the first time, or the last, that she flipped her shit about BIL. She has done this right in front of us before, or over the phone with my husband if we're not around. She withholds information from husband about BIL a lot to cover for him, and because husband is very vocal about how big of a turd BIL is.\n\nSo the day comes and she picks daughter up and claims that FIL is meeting them at the restaurant. I'm already annoyed by them driving separately, but bite my tongue. They go out, and being a little paranoid, I have my husband call to check on them after a few hours. MIL answers the phone and states they are at the mall painting and FIL \"just left\".  I'm annoyed, but let it go. That is...until I find out that FIL actually didn't go to the mall with them at all, and took off after eating. FIL calls and states the truth without any hesitation, which I find odd. So I begin thinking this whole situation may be partially my husband's fault, and that he is not explaining things clearly or something. However, MIL made it seem like FIL just left (IMO lied to us) so I also think she must have understood the situation enough to try to manipulate it. \n\nSo at this point I have 0 trust left and tell my husband that his parents fucked up their last chance and I'm done. It's been roughly 8 or 9 months now and they haven't been with daughter alone once. Just the other day I heard MIL tell my daughter that she wants to take her to the spa at the mall and she'd need to \"ask Mommy\" about it. Then a few days later, my husband suggests I have MIL come over to babysit while I'm attending an online meeting upstairs. I basically ignore these comments/suggestions when they're made, but I know it will only be a short amount of time before I'm straight out asked to reconsider. I'm actually shocked it hasn't come up sooner. \n\nThis whole situation has made me feel like an asshole at times, and not others, I truly go back and forth. My husband has accused me of always hating his mom and seeing an opportunity to get what I wanted (less of her). Some relevant, yet bias, info: MIL often talks negatively about people, put service people down (for their physical features) if they piss her off, and is just generally a negative, emotional black hole of despair. I've also heard her say a few mean/accusatory things about her other granddaughter's mother \"accidentally\" in front of her. So I was never 100% trusting of her alone with my daughter to begin with. In other words, maybe I am overreacting to the situation considering I didn't really trust and definitely didn't like her before.\n\nAnd I honestly do feel guilty about keeping MIL and FIL away from their granddaughter, but we still visit with them at least once a week. Daughter doesn't question the sudden lack of alone time, and sometimes even hides away from them when they visit (I have no idea what that's about, she won't tell me and she doesn't do it with any other visitors. I think it's because they spend the entire time talking about boring stuff with husband.) This is way too long, I'm sorry, so just tell me already: Am I the asshole? ",

It was bad, we know, but we were both in really bad (abusive in my case) relationships. All said nothing came out of those incidents. We discussed it, but neither of us has any romantic or sexual feelings toward the other anymore.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo long story short, a few nights ago, this friend (who now works as a tech consultant) had to go visit a client who's office was really close to my place. The office was a 5 minutes drive from my place, v.s an hour commute from her place. Since she had to meet the client very early in the morning, she asked me if she could sleep on my couch, so that she would not have to deal with the long commute. I said that it was fine.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I called my girlfriend to tell her about this she got really angry. My girlfriend feels that even though I say that the friendship between me and this friend is platonic, it is not, and what I did exhibit a lack of boundaries. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI argued that letting close friends sleep on my couch, regardless of gender is something that I've done in the past many times and she's was okay with that, but this situation is different because she doesn't like that specific friend. So the act of letting my friend crash at my place is not inherently wrong, it just feels wrong to her because she doesn't like that specific friend.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll in all, my friend slept over, my girlfriend got really angry and we had a long talk about it today, and we are now okay, but I'm left wondering, AITA?",

One of the first things she asked was “What color of boys do you like?” and he got awkward and uncomfortable. I told my mom she can’t say that, in a joking way, and she doubled down and said “No, I mean do you only date your own race or do you like white, brown, asian, latino....” My brother just flat out said “mom, you’re being racist.” She got really defensive and said “What? I’m not allowed to have preferences? If I only was attracted to black men would that make me racist?” \n\n\nMy brother’s friend and I both tried explaining that it IS okay to have personal preferences but telling everyone is pretty weird; it’d also be rude to tell someone you’re not attracted to them specifically because of their race, as it is something they cannot change. She half conceded and left the room, asking my brother to come with her. I heard them arguing and she started crying and saying she’s the “best mom ever” and she’s only ever taught us kindness and acceptance. \n\n\nI later on tried to bring it up again, but my brother was there and he can’t help but throw jabs and insults at my mom. They got really heated over it again, so I told my brother to shut up for a minute so I could talk. I tried explaining that small differences in the way you talk to people can really change the way you’re perceived by people. Asking a black gay boy what “color” of boys he likes is not the most tasteful or appropriate thing to say. She said she didn’t ask what color of boys he liked and that our “oversensitive millennial brains” misheard her and twisted reality. \n\n\nAt this point, I knew the argument wasn’t worth having. My mom isn’t the kind of person to complain about “snowflakes” and the like, so I knew she was just deflecting by throwing insults. I told everyone to quash it and go about their business. My mother is not an emotionally mature woman. She’s been addicted to drugs for half her life and never properly socialized. Now that’s she’s sober, she’s learning how to be an adult and a regular member of society. \n\n\nShe also didn’t grow up like me and my brother. The schools we grew up in were incredibly diverse. People of color are not a novelty to me or my brother. Most of our friends are not white and we don’t think about it too much. My mom likes to bring it up a lot. She tends to fetishize people of color. She recently saw some baby pictures of my brother’s girlfriend (who is asian) and hasn’t shut up about who she can’t wait for them to have kids because she’s always wanted that “flavor” of grandbaby. I think don’t she means any harm but she seems to confuse attraction for acceptance. (e.g. “I’m not racist, my girlfriend is black.”)\n\n\nDespite all this, she’s still my mother and I love her dearly. I feel like I could’ve handled this situation better. I don’t feel like it was appropriate for my brother to accuse her of being racist in front of his friend, but it also makes me uncomfortable how she treats POC (and gay people) like they’re a novelty. \n\n\nSo Reddit, am I the asshole? \n\n\nTL;DR Mom asked black gay friend what “color of boys” he liked and we told her it was inappropriate.

There were puppies there and the store manager said that a few of the dogs would be \"destroyed\" when they eventually leave for a multitude of reasons. It was probably a combination of the mimosas we had earlier + the cuteness of the puppies but I ultimately agreed to buy one of the dogs because I couldn't stand the thought of it being put down. \n\nWhen my husband got home later that night he was furious that I had spent so much on a new puppy without telling him. He told me I was probably duped by that store and I don't disagree, but I also believe I did the right thing bringing that puppy away from that horrid store. He is mad that I did all this without asking him and I did apologize but I feel like he should cut me some slack. I only acted out of compassion and was just a bit overwhelmed by what that store manager was telling me. And besides, getting a cute puppy is hardly the worst thing to happen to anyone.

It was really rough growing up and being so outnumbered all the time so i love to \"bro out\" for lack of better words. \nCurrent story: TDLR at bottom We are all in early 20s. Once we all graduated high school my mom moved into a much smaller house 20 minutes away and allows us to live in the old house for very cheap (she doesnt make money or lose money, we pay utilities, taxes, etc) until we get on our feet as adults. My 2 little sisters both took the deal(while me and twin where in college, they didn't go) and have since bought their own house or moved out the area. I recently graduated, moved in and got 2 roommates, keeping 1 bedroom open for my twin if she decides to live with us. The thing is I don't want her to. We live together during the summers and dont get along. We went to the same college and went out together and had fun, shes one of my best friends, but when we are together too long we arnt nice to each other. My 2 roommates are long time friends and Id say now they are just as much friends with my sister as with me, they have no problem with her moving in. \nThe thing is , I love the atmosphere of the house, its the definition of a bachelors pad (pool table in dining room, bench press in living room, bikini posters, deer heads, etc). Im worried that my sister might kill the vibes living here when she could very easily live with my mom 20 min away(for free) and visit whenever. The only thing is she has expressed excitement for being roommates and I really don't want to hurt her feelings because she is sensitive and its not like its any more my house than hers. \n\nAdditionally, my little sister that moved away is talking of maybe moving back in and sharing the room with my twin. This would be 100% a nightmare, my little sister is not easy to get along with and those two sharing a room would be awful for everyone involved. The thing is my mom said little sister cannot live with her(for above reasons) but twin can. Plus I wouldnt mind little sister living here as much because she would just stay in her room all the time and because she is intellectually disabled and she worries me being alone in the city. \nTDLR; Mom lets us stay in other house for very cheap. I moved in made it a bachelors pad with 2 friends and don't want my twin sister to live here. WIBTA to tell her this as it will likely hurt her feelings",

		"story": "TL;DR bottom. \n\nEver since I was little, I hated going to people’s houses. It’s like having a mini-panic attack walking through the door of someone’s home because I won’t eat there, I won’t drink there, I find it super stressful to use their bathroom, I don’t even really like to use their furniture. I actually get so stressed that I feel physically ill. It’s not just friends, I don’t go to my  family’s houses either, I barely go to my mothers house. Because of this, I just avoid going to houses. Everyone knows that yes, I do want to see you, and if you don’t feel like visiting me, we can always go out somewhere and do something. Never been a problem with anyone in my life, it’s not like I never see them because of it...save for one person. \n\nI met my best friend in middle school, a decade ago. I went to her house sometimes but very rarely. She ended up bringing it up, so I told her what I told everyone else. I made a little extra effort to go to her house once in a while and things were fine for a bit, but then I tapered off. Once or twice a year she would get angry at me and every time we would have the same argument, just a little more in detailed as I got older, and I’d beg her to please just let it go. \n\nI hang out with her at my house, or the bar, or a concert, or fishing, hiking, eating, movies, etc. I enjoy spending time with her, but I rarely go to her house. A few days ago, she asks if she can come down and do her homework, I say yes. I get home from work and get a text saying she decided to do it at her house instead. After my shower I text her that I’m ready, no response. \n\nShe texts me out of the blue saying it’s really bothering her that I won’t come to her house, that I’m being a hypocrite because I went to my boyfriends house in high school. I told her that’s because I was dating him and still rarely went to his house to do more than meet him. Said I avoid *everybody’s* houses and I’m willing to go anywhere with her besides that. She said I’m “making it sound like it’s a part of my personality when it’s not” and “you don’t even want to work on it for me.” It has never not been a part of my life,  it doesn’t pose an issue to me, my family, my friends, boyfriends...only her. \n\nI compared it to if she was afraid of snakes. If I knew she was that anxious about them, that she would avoid them at all costs, I would never ask her to force herself to come stand with me in a snake room. I wouldn’t be pissed off at her for not wanting to work on that for me. She won’t speak to me, I haven’t heard from her in days. \n\n\nTL;DR I have super anxiety about being in people’s houses. Everybody in my life is cool with it, except for my best friend. Argue at least once a year, I apologize and beg her to let it go.

		"story": "I'm sorry, if this post is a little messy and difficult to follow, this just happened about an hour ago and I'm still pretty shaken up. Like any teenager in the twenty-first century I've made my fair share of borderline inappropriate suicide jokes, so I just want to start this off by saying I take every \"edgy\" remark with a grain of salt and calling the police really was the last thing I resorted to. Also, I live in Germany, so I didn't literally call 911, but the German emergency number, but I'll be referring to it as 911 for the sake of simplicity.\n\nThis afternoon, a mutual follower messaged me on instagram and told me he was going to commit suicide. This is not an unfamiliar situation to me, I've talked multiple friends out of moods in which they might feel like doing something stupid, so I attempted to have a conversation with him, asked him if he had anyone he could talk to, if he wanted to talk to me about it, stuff like that. The messages, which were mostly audio recordings, grew increasingly serious to the point where I was starting to think he could be in actual danger. He told me he had deep cuts on his upper arm and I told him to call 911 more than once. Still I thought he might be exaggerating and he didn't talk about any injuries anywhere near his arteries.  I also told him to get professional help which he said he'd been getting for years now. After a few hours of me trying all kinds of arguments to get this stranger to change his mind, he sent me a picture of sleeping pills. When I asked him how many he'd taken, he was very nonspecific. His speech was slurred, which obviously he could have faked, but I tend to take people seriously when they make suicidal threads because I have had a bad experience with someone who was not kidding about it. I proceeded to tell him that I would call 911, if he didn't respond within the next few minutes. I thought if it really was just a cry for help, he would answer immediately to avoid the police getting involved. Now I didn't know his real name, address or telephone number, all I had was the city he lived in, as stated in his instagram bio. At this point I really didn't know what else to do, so I called the police and told them about what had happened. Long story short, the operator asked to speak to my parents over the phone and two policemen arrived at our doorstep about 15 minutes later. \nTwo minutes, two fucking minutes before the police arrived, the guy texted me back and told me he'd thrown up the pills and was okay. He still sounded like he was about to pass out and his speech was even more slurred than before. Now I was standing there like an idiot, two annoyed policemen asking questions and treating me like the biggest idiot on the planet when I repeatedly told them that I didn't know the guy, nor had his real name, address or phone number. Just to make the situation even more embarrassing, I broke down crying in front of them. The older one of the two kept lecturing me about \"giving out my personal details to strangers\" and how he thought the account was probably fake (I can assure you, it was absolutely not, also I literally had multiple recordings of his actual voice which made it very obvious that he was in fact not a 50 year old man trying to \"talk to young girls\") and was completely irritated by the concept of talking to someone without seeing their face in real life. The younger one took me slightly more seriously, he took a few photos of the conversation, made a video of my screen while I played one if the audios and we eventually managed to get the number of the guy who was messaging me, so they could attempt to track him down and get help to him, if needed. I stopped texting him after that, knowing I couldn't tell him I'd called the police because I didn't want him to panic and hurt himself again and I honestly didn't want to continue the conversation because it's sort of messed up to send serious suicide threats to a complete stranger. \nAfter that, I had to listen to another lecture by my parents (my mother thinks I'm suicidal now, because why else would I keep talking to someone who threatened to kill himself, not like humans feel some sort of obligation to help in these situations) and I just feel terrible about the whole things. The officers told me I'd done the right thing calling the police, but still suggested that teens who cut themselves shouldn't be taken seriously concerning these kinds of threats and that I really should have known better. \n\n\nAm I the asshole for calling the police because I was worried and possibly having them show up on this guy's doorstep later that night?\nAm I the asshole for wasting those officers' time while there are probably a ton of more important things going on that they should have been looking after?\nAm I just naive for believing he might be in actual danger?",

Even when I did smoke I would properly dispose of my cigarette butts and not just litter and throw them on the ground. I had to go out in 20 degree weather and pick up EVERYONE'S cigarette butts and then got back into the store, vented about how I shouldn't have to pick up others cigarette butts when I don't smoke, and went about my workday. 20 minutes goes by and I'm getting mocked by co-workers for venting to my GM about the cigarette butts because now there's a sign saying they have to pick up their own cigarette butts or they will get written up.  \n\n\nThanks for your time reddit. I just needed to vent a little more and get others opinions on the situation.",

		"story": "This happened a few months ago, but I am having a hard time letting this go, and I feel as though my parents and my relationship is permanently messed up now. Will try and be as brief as possible-\n\nHusband and I have two kids, and when my first son was born my mom offered to provide childcare for us, and did so for 3.5 years.  Obviously this was a huge undertaking, I am extremely grateful they did this, obviously saved us a ton of money and emotional turmoil, etc. I made every effort to be as appreciative as I could possibly be. \n\nAfter kid 1 was born, my mom came to my house (30 minute drive each way) every day. After kid 2 was born, they asked that we drive the kids up to them in the morning, and said they would bring them back.  We did this for a few months, but it became a huge pain in the ass to get two kids out of the house by 6:30 in the morning, drive 30 minutes, drop kids off, then drive 30 minutes back to work, since we used to live literally right next to my work.  Also, I started feeling SO much guilt about my parents doing the drive back, obviously a huge pain in the ass for them as well. \n\nHusband never really understood the problem with this, mostly due to him never having to do it (leaves for work too early).  Parents and I start talking about us moving closer to make things easier on everyone.  Took a while to convince husband, as he did not want to live in the area that parents live in (neither did I, just random suburban sprawl away from city center) Finally wore him down, as the drive was making me and parents batty, and as winter approached I started to worry about the safety of the kids being in the car that much. \n\nSince it was wintertime and we needed the move to be “worth it” (as in, within 5 miles of parents) we didn’t have many houses to choose from.  We ended up settling on a house that is NOT what we ever would have wanted for a variety of reasons- but it was mere blocks away from my parents, so we bought it.  Mortgage payment is double what we were paying before, not ideal, but its a more expensive area and we still had leftover cash each month, so no biggie. \n\nMy commute to work is now 45 minutes to an hour each way, which sucks, but is still less than I was driving before, and now I don’t have kids screaming in the back. During house hunting process, my parents were ALL ABOUT IT, so excited, couldn’t wait to have the setup be easier also.  I asked them, SO MANY TIMES, “are you guys SURE you want to keep doing this?? because if we move, thats a commitment, and we won’t be able to afford a daycare at that point.” Yep, they reassured me it was fine.  About halfway through the year, at mom’s request, I enrolled older son in part-time preschool and also hired some part-time help for my mom. She then asked for me to pay for more help or more days at preschool, and I told her that I was sorry but I could not afford to do so. \n\nThis was all good for about eight months, when my mom (who has a variety of health issues) gets very ill and is suddenly hospitalized for two weeks.  Learning of this sent us into instant panic mode, obviously because we were concerned about her health, but also because we had no backup childcare plan. I stayed home for a week, cobbled together babysitters for another two weeks (which was hell, since kids were NOT used to that), and burned through our extra cash for that month doing so. NBD I think, just gotta get through this illness. \n\nThen I get a text message from mom that says “my doctor thinks taking care of children has taken a toll on my health and I need to quit. I don’t want to leave you hanging, so heres the name of an in-home daycare.” \n\nThis text threw me into a rage fit.  Not only do I not have time to look into this daycare, which I don’t like, but asking me to suddenly cough up an additional $1600 a month AFTER I had used all the spare cash that month on babysitters is the DEFINITION of leaving us hanging. I asked if my dad could fill in a day or two and she replied “there comes a time when you need to look outside family for help.” WTF \n\nI was honestly so angry and stressed that I could not even manage to talk to her for weeks. The in-home daycare lady even ended up filling the spot before I could even get there, so that was not an option, and all of the daycares around us had year-long waiting lists. Over the next three months, ended up burning through huge chunk of savings to pay friends and care.com people to watch kids, while I spent many sleepless nights stressing about what to do. \n\nMom was still pretty sick for a while, so I was also trying my best not to let her know I was so upset while she was trying to heal.  Finally when we got together to “talk,” and I talked calmly through my anger, she just seemed...bewildered?  No matter how many times I explained it to her she did not get why I was so angry. Still doesn’t. We have had THREE hour-plus conversations and at the start she always says “I just don’t see why you are so angry with me. I took care of the boys for years, I did a good job.” I have never disputed that! I have fallen allll over myself to be properly appreciative, the point is that they never acknowledged, in any way shape or form, the sudden, extreme financial burden that they placed on us.  \n\nTo be totally clear, I completely agree that she needed to stop doing childcare for us, completely legit.  Of course moms health is important to me, and I know she needed to stop. And I am extremely grateful for all that they did provide.  BUT now we are barely making ends meet, through connections we found daycare spots but are now paying $1900 a month, AND the kids are getting sick so often that I frequently have to shell out for emergency sick child care at $160 a day. \n\nI have tried every which way to explain this to her, and I don’t know if it is because they have always been well-off and don’t think about monthly budgets, or what, but they don’t get this at all. They keep saying, “I thought you guys were fine?!?” uhh, you mean all those times I told you I couldn’t afford 3 day a week preschool??  \n\nMom actually said “but you told me you had a decent amount of money saved?”  You mean my 401K??? you want me to burn through that until the kids are in kindergarten?” to which she replied “sometimes parents have to make tough choices.” what???  that is a real solution in her mind? \n\nSo now we are faced with moving to a cheaper place, less than a year after we moved here, which would put us in the position of trying to find another daycare spot in a different area, which is damn near impossible.  We would almost certainly lose money on this house.  Although we don’t love this place, moving sucks and neither of us are keen to do it again. \n\nWhat I can’t get over is why they have never offered us money. Still haven’t.  When they know we are struggling.  I understand that when mom first got sick she was probably in panic mode too and wasnt thinking about the money aspect, which I totally get. But now it has been months, they KNOW we are really having a hard time, and just...nothing?  When we moved partly at their urging?  They have the money, they absolutely do. They have given us money twice before as a gift (for our wedding, then for kids college fund) so it isnt like that doesnt occur to them.  I don’t feel like I can ask flat-out for a variety of reasons that would take too long to explain. \n\nTL;DR- parents suddenly tapped out of childcare due to health problems, after we moved less than a year ago to make the setup easier.  We now live in a house we don’t like, in an area we don’t want to live in, and can no longer afford now that we have the additional expense of childcare.  Am I out of line for thinking they should be helping pay to get us out of this situation?\n",

		"story": "In the first quarter of grades in my school, I had two pretty bad quiz grades, which brought my grade total to a 75. Because my grades will be sent out to colleges she bumped up my grade (along with other students) to an 80. \n\nLast Wednesday she gave us 2 worksheets to do, and we had to translate 2 pages of a book we’re reading. She told us these were due Friday, and that we would have a substitute on that Thursday. That substitute got some messed up instructions and told us to finish the translation by that class. I did. The substitute then told us that the other 2 papers would be due the next day (Friday). I did one after school and planned to finish the other one during class. Friday arrives and I start working on the worksheet, and my Italian teacher tells us that she said on Wednesday that the two papers and translation were both due on Thursday (the day before) and took my empty paper and counted it as a grade. I was understandably upset at the substitute for giving us faulty information, because maybe I heard her wrong on Wednesday. Italian teacher tells me that it was all my fault. I explain that I was sorry, that my Grandmother was in the hospital (she was brought into the hospital Thursday afternoon, returned home Friday night), and that my mind is in another place. She said that my grandmother being in the hospital is what I get for not doing my homework.\n\nThat Saturday night I had a few friends over (One of them has had her in the past, another one has the same Italian class as I, and my last friend has never had this teacher). Together we made a video called “[Redacted] High School staff portrayed by Spongebob”. For the two other Italian teachers we used the Ravioli Ravioli scene. For my current Italian teacher we used the “When people want to sound smart the talk loud, right?” “Correct” scene from the episode Band geeks. For other teachers and school staff, we made fun of they’re bald, called them terrible cops, and made fun of their personalities. My current Italian teacher is the only teacher who didn’t enjoy it, as when I walked in to class this morning she said she was mad at me and explained why.\n\nI’d also like to make it a point that my friend who is also in my Italian class was the one with the Idea for her spongebob scene, and I was insisting against its inclusion, but it made it in anyways. My friend took credit for that scene, but Im the one who she’s mad at. Finally I’d like to add that the teacher is loud, and she even points it out.",

		"story": "Long time lurker - finally posting for the first time please bear with me here \n\nFor the past couple of weeks I was seeing this guy casually (N) that I met off Tinder and things were going pretty well. I work 5 days a week including one weekend day at a medical clinic with long hours so I go to sleep pretty early to make sure I'm well rested. Saturday I went on a small day trip with my friends and got back home during the early evening. Now throughout the day Saturday, N texted me asking me about how the trip was going and what time I\"d be home so he could drive over to see me. Fast forward to the evening when I'm home and he texts me that when his errand is done at 9pm, he'd drive over. So now that I have a time frame as to what time he would arrive, I shower, unpack my things and settle in to wait for him. 9pm rolls around and suddenly he messages that he can't make it. Whatever. Fine. He's flaked a few times before so it came as no surprise. I text him back no problem and to have a safe drive home. \n\nSunday comes and I'm exhausted from the day trip before still but I run a few errands for my mom because she was sick in bed that day and also prepare dinner for the family. N and I were texting sparsely throughout the day mostly just asking after each other but not really saying if we wanted to see each other that day because I had work on Monday early as usual. 8pm rolls around and I'm serving food to everyone when I get a text from N that says \"I'm coming now\" and I start freaking out because I'm eating dinner with my family and we aren't nearly close enough or even a thing where I can introduce him to anyone. I text him back in all caps saying not to come because I was eating dinner with my family and then radio silence from him. After dinner, I clean up and start getting ready for bed because there was still no text from him after I told him I was eating dinner so I assumed he wasn't coming. He didn't say \"what time are you done with dinner I'll come over\" or \"let me know when I can come\" so I just went to bed at 9:00pm because I wake up around 6am for work everyday and I was already tired from earlier. The next morning I wake up to a text from him at 9:44pm Sunday night saying \"\"ok good, how about now\" followed by \"i'm outside let me in\". Well folks, I just about shit my pants. Immediately texted him back apologies on how I fell asleep but still haven't gotten any responses from him. To throw it out there - this guy has flaked a few times times throughout our few weeks of knowing each other so I didn't know if he was actually going to follow through on coming over in freezing weather ( he has my address from a previous visit) plus the actual lack of communication on his part is making me a little nuts. AITA??\n\nTL:DR - fell asleep on a guy who didn't really say he was coming to my house UNTIL HE TEXTED HE WAS AT MY HOUSE. ",

		"story": "So the problem is like this. I live in a rented apartment, with a friend from work (lets call him A) for 3 years now. We know each other from college, but really got friends when we moved together in a new city. Now the apartment has 2 bedrooms, one for each of us ( he insisted he wants the bigger one, I didn't care that much and let him have it) and a somewhat spacious living room. We pay equally the rent, with me doing the actually pay and all the effort done to discuss any damages that happen, any roads to facilities or stuff like that, while my friend pays half and that's about it, 0 effort and expects for everything to be done for him like he is entitled.\nSome friends of mine decided they would like to visit me in the weekend (one of my best friends from high school together with his gf and 2 of her friends ). A leaves almsot every Friday to visits his gf and returns late Sunday.  I discussed with him if my hometown friends can visit and stay in our apartment, he was OK with it and said he is thinking if anyone can sleep in his room (that was last week). Wednesday comes and i ask him again about it and he vehemently says no, that his room is not \"prepared\" to have guests and that he is om with people coming in the house, but they are not to sleep in his bed/room. Meanwhile another of my best friends from highschool decided to join totaling 5 people to be accommodated in my bed and a lousy couch in the living room, that can barely accommodate one person and with little time for my friends to rent something cheap to sleep through the weekend while visiting me. \nHe refuses to have guests in the house, if the house is dirty or not cleaned, while he is lazy (we both are) to clean most of the time. He hates people getting in his apartment while its not clean with such a passion, he declines instantly any visit no matter how far the person has traveled to see him or how rare that ever happens. That's his quirk, its either clean or no visit. I know about this quirk, we had another similar fight some time ago, thats why I asked him before hand to clean up or to at least tell me with some time ahead if will do that or not, so that my friends can find something to rent. Thursday he didn't have the time or the mood to clean and thats why he declined my requests to have the 2 girls sleep in his room.\n\nI \"was forced\" to let the couple sleep in my room, me and my other high-school bestie slept on the couch and the other 2 girls slept in my friends(A) room. He now accuses me that I broke boundaries, his trust and that I was an asshole for not even asking him in the last moment. I believe its his own fault for taking to long to decide.  We are in a pretty big fight about this whole incident. AITA for letting the girls sleep in his bed? \n\nTLDR from above: My flat mate of 3 years is pissed at me that i let 2 girls sleep in his room even tho i asked him ahead of time to let the girls know if they should rent a room or stay in our apartment.\n ",

My parents had a nasty divorce and I have a strained relationship with my mom due to her taking out her anger on my dad towards me. \n\nMy dad and stepmom picked me up last night around 12am. I was busy packing and loading stuff into the car so when we left my bf’s place I was exhausted. It didn’t even occur to me to text/call my mom to let her know I’m moving back to the area my dad &amp; mom live in. \n\nMy dad &amp; I couldn’t sleep in the car until 6am since my stepmom is a magnet for “otherworldly” occurrences, so when we arrived at the house I had no energy. I know I sleep for a while so I wanted to clean before going to bed. I reorganized my bedroom, unpacked my belongings, did 2 loads of laundry and showered. \n\nAn hour or two before I got into bed my mom texted me asking for my bf’s address to send me something. I didn’t want to reply until I was done settling in, so when I was finally in bed I texted her “I’m back at my dad’s place”. \n\n3 hours later I awoke to my phone blowing up. \n\nMom: Since when? Didn’t even call me?\n\nMom: &lt;paragraph of me needing to get my life together, let her know when I want to pay back my student loan that’s under her name, “have a nice life”.&gt;\n\nMe: I was awake all night.

I was unpacking and cleaning all afternoon. \n\nMom: You’re so ungrateful!!!\n\nMe: You don’t understand how tired I am, why are you getting angry out of nowhere? Please don’t text me hurtful stuff. \n\nMom: &lt;2 long paragraphs of “I am your mom”, “I wanted you to be better than your sperm donor”, “I’m done with you and your dad”, “I’m canceling your phone service don’t call or contact me anymore”&gt;\n\nMe: I didn’t do anything besides try to sleep.

For the uninitiated, it's a 28mm scale tabletop strategy wargame played with plastic models that has a TON of different armies to choose from. We're talking humans (Imperial Guard), Orks, Eldar (Space Elves), Space Marines, and most fantasy things one's heart could desire.\n\n Larry likes to play the faction known as the Space Marines, and recently has been wanting some Imperial Guard to go with them. However, I already play Imperial Guard in the small group of people Larry and I include in our WH40k playing. I've never played anything else for the almost year I've been into the game, and these models require a lot of dedication. They're priced exorbitantly high (go to the Games Workshop and look at Warhammer 40,000 models website if you don't believe me), and they come unassembled and unpainted, meaning there's a lot of work one has to put into their model into making it look presentable and getting it to your standards. We're talking hours at a time for a single model sometimes. **Long story short,** these models take a lot of work and are expensive. \n\n With all this being put together, especially with the fact I feel he has many other factions to choose from, I don't want him to start collecting this army.

		"story": "Hi Reddit! I actually posted this late last night but didn’t get many replies because it was an awkward time. I’m hoping you can help me with an ongoing debate I have with my brother and father. One of my guy friends who I hang out with a few times a year admitted that he liked me a year ago. I told him that I think he’s an awesome guy, but I only see him as a friend and that I am not interested in anything more. I also said that I understand if he no longer wants to be friends with me but he said he didn’t want to lose me as a friend and that he will get over it. \n\nThe issue is that when I hang out with this guy it’s still obvious he likes me. When I was home visiting my family for Christmas this issue somehow came up in conversation and my dad and brother said I should cut this friend off to spare his feelings. They said even tho I shut him down he will continue to try to change my mind “because that’s just how guys are”. I said it was unfair because I made my feelings very clear and that if he was still choosing to pursue me he wasn’t respecting my decision and that is not my fault. My brother and dad said that it is my fault because I know his feelings and am still choosing to give him hope by keeping him as a friend and that I should be the bigger person and end the friendship. \n\nI guess this struck a nerve with me because I’ve been verbally and physically harassed by men (cat called, groped in bars more times than I can count, hit back when I finally hit the old guy who came up to me and started to grope me), and I’m sick and tired for having to control my actions because “that’s just how guys are”. Obviously those are much more extreme cases but I guess those experiences have influenced my mindset when it comes to this point and makes me more angry and stubborn and perhaps I cannot see the issue clearly. It even angers me that my dad and brother are saying my guy friend will say he’s ok and wants nothing more and it that it’s only natural he will continue to try to win me over. I think that’s deceptive and that if he is doing that then he is only to blame for any pain caused because he is the one who is lying to me and choosing not to respect my decision. I would understand if he was honest with me and said he had to cut me out because I have had another male friend do this in the past and have respected his decision. But then again I’ve also had unreturned feelings for people and so understand it can be heartbreaking. I guess where my issue lies is that the blame is on me to end the friendship because “that’s just how guys are”.\n\nSo I’d really love your input Reddit. AITA?\n\nTLDR: guy friend told me that he likes me. I told him I wasn’t interested and only like him as a friend and understood if he didn’t want to be friends. He said he could handle it and didn’t want to lose the friendship. It’s obvious he still likes me. AITA for remaining friends with him?",

She asked me to pass her this big plate of shrimp rice so that she could try some of that.

However, my husband and I work long hours and we have two cats at home. They were tearing apart the apartment before we got the bird feeders and now have settled down. They spend most of the day watching the birds now instead of trying to tunnel through our walls (we watch them via nest cameras).\n&gt; \n&gt; So this has left us in a bit of a pickle.

There is plenty of parking elsewhere in the complex but he wants to park closest to his apartment entrance. No one else, to our knowledge, has complained.\n&gt; \n&gt; His argument is that I am attracting these birds and ruining his enjoyment (?) of the property. I'll also add there is no assigned parking. I park basically next to him, just not under the tree and I get maybe one maybe two poops a week.

Now I'm not heartless so as long as they look well kept, don't smell, are sober and arnt standing out (none of this is difficult in Stockholm since we have \"roof over head guarantee\" so you can sleep for free at a shelter, grab a shower a small breakfast and if lucky, laundry).\n\nOne of our regulars is a alcoholic and he has been for 52 years. Most of the time he is well behaved and not drunk in the mall but the times he is I escort him out into the cold and wish him luck for the night to come. When he was shit faced enough to smoke inside the mall I decided that enough is enough and banned him from the mall (he isnt a customer and never has been). \n\nNow to the story, this is my first shift back from a vacation and I haven't been at work for a week my team leader notified me that my ban of the regular has been lifted (been in place for 2 months) due to \"he can't be banned for life, that's just unfair\". Since he is my superior I accept under protest. I work nights and I mainly deal with homeless people and junkies while my team leader works daytime and deals with mall business. My shift rolls on...\n\n... at 23:35 our regular rolls around and since he has a very distinct walk I notice him on the CCTV right away. He sits down in one of the armchairs and promptly falls asleep (now I don't allow anyone to sleep in the mall plus I know that he has received a flat from the welfare state). I'm lazy and tell myself that I he can sleep until I close the mall at 00:00.\n\nDuring closing one of the roller-gates won't function so I call the on-call guy (OC) and try to troubleshoot this gate and while I'm on the phone I have to keep emptying the mall and lock the rest of the doors. Our regular knows OC and apparently he has promised the regular a carton of cigarettes. When I wake the regular up and tell him it's time to leave he denies sleeping and then demands to know who I'm talking to and I say that it's OC and I'm trying to sort some stuff out. Regular demands to talk to OC - I say no, we are busy... Regular demands to know where his smokes are - I offer to ask when we are done. As this is going on I'm escorting him to the last door that I need to close and this takes us past a restaurant that is open (they have their own entrance) and regular decides to throw a hissy-fit and yell \"I WANT MY SMOKES NOW\". I tell OC that I will call him back and I put my phone away. I order the regular to leave since he is causing a breach of peace and we are closed. He flat out refuses and I put a hand on his back as I'm explaining that this is not acceptable behaviour and he needs to behave if he dosent want to get banned again.\n\nHe flails his arms like a child in response which results in a punch to my jaw - I'm 181cm of swedish private security and he is 155cm of elderly alcoholism. I littally pick him up and walk him outside and as morning rolls around I tell what happened to my team leader and back it up with CCTV footage and OCs word.\n\nTeam leader sais that im being harsh and an assholefor wanting the ban reestablished\n\n\nShould i look the other way because he is homeless(ish) and 70 years old?

If someone spreads false information that affects your relationship, it’s reasonable to discuss your discomfort with that person spending time with your partner. However, ensure that your request is framed as a concern for your relationship rather than control. Balance is key; mutual respect and understanding are essential in addressing boundaries without coming off as possessive. If your partner feels controlled, consider discussing your feelings more deeply to find a compromise."

For an average student like me, I stand little to no chance in landing a tenure-track position even at an \"average\" university. What awaited me was post-doc purgatory and adjunct teaching, where you make a \\*pittance\\* for the amount of education you have invested in yourself. Foreseeing this, I noped the fuck out and jumped to the job market.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEnter my GF. She is a 28 years old Masters student in engineering. She has informed me on several occasions that she wants to pursue a Ph.D after graduating from her current program. I have been urging her to think twice about this momentous decision. Here are my arguments as to why I think a Ph.D is not good for her:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. The Ph.D department she wants to go to is not that highly-ranked. Landing a tenure-track position after graduating from there is a snowball chance in hell.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2. You don't need a Ph.D in engineering to thrive in the professional/industrial job market.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3. She has never been on the job market. How would she know she wouldn't like it?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n4. I don't think she knows what she's getting into. It's clear she hasn't thoroughly researched this career path. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n5. She's not that young anymore. Do you really want to use your prime years for an endeavor with highly uncertain payoff? Even if you manage to get a job after, that's \\~5 years of opportunity cost gone. That's \\~5 years in which you could have been working because a Masters is perfectly \\*sufficient\\* already. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n6. I don't think her personality is good for academia. She is a very quiet and somewhat passive. Teaching, competing for grants, going to conferences, and all that jazz would probably be tough for her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n7. Hell, if the Ph.D is really needed for her next promotion, what prevents her from going \\*back\\* to it after gaining some work experience on the job market first?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMost importantly, though, it's that I see myself in her. I believe I was in her shoes 4 years ago. I do not want her to make the same mistake I did. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, here's where I could be the asshole:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. She's allowed to do whatever the fuck she wants. Maybe I can give her some (unsolicited?) advice, but it's not my purview to tell her what to do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2. The big one: I'm not that young anymore either. I'm also materialistic. Basically, I don't want a future in which my partner doesn't really contribute to the American Dream because she's still studying as an 30+ years old. If we are to share our life together, I'd want her to work. I'm scared of the uncertainty that her preferred career path brings.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBecause I legit care about her and \\*because I want someone who can help me create the future I want\\*, I've been trying to dissuade her from pursuing her goal.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA?",

They knew what I knew and the rumors around our complex. Most importantly they knew I was currently homeless as of that night and I had nothing but the clothes on my back and my phone \n\nWhen I got to my classes they kept asking me how I was doing and if I was okay and I finally just snapped. Obviously I wasn’t okay. With everything going on. So I slightly rose my voice at them and said “why does everyone keep asking if I’m okay when I’m obviously not okay.” And we left it at that. I was quiet the rest of the day not feeling up for the day.\n\nJump back in to the following Monday. I get to class and I go to one of my friends and ask her how her weekend was. She literally ignored me. Its not like she didn’t know I was talking to her. I looked right at her and spoke loudly and clearly and she didn’t even acknowledge me.\n\nI thought it was weird, but I brushed it off My other friend told me we needed to talk after class and was very short with me so I thought that was definitely weird. \n\nWhen class ended they confronted me and said “on friday when you yelled at us I don’t think that was right. We were just asking how you were and trying to be good friends and we really don’t think it was necessary for you to do that and it really hurt us.” And I was shocked at the fact that I went through two hardships in one week and they knew about it and were asking me to apologize. As someone who hates confrontation I apologized cause I did understand that I probably shouldn’t have been as snappy as I was. \n\nEven after I apologized I felt like I shouldn’t have and really didn’t need to. My grandma died, i almost died, I’m homeless, one of my cats is lost or dead, i lost everything, and I have no idea whats next. Yeah I’m gonna lash out at someone. I wasn’t mad at them at the time I just wanted to stopped being asked the question and I was just so angry at the world. \n\nI feel like they could’ve and should’ve understood all I was going through and realized maybe I didn’t need the extra stress of me thinking they now hate me (they were purposely ignoring me) and just let it go.\n\nHonestly, am I the asshole \n",

I've tried having several conversations with her over the years, all which come to the same ending: I cannot take our daughter anywhere without her being present because she does not trust me and is scared that something might happen to our daughter. I have done nothing to warrant this fear of hers. I have been in the picture since the day she was born, but was away at college for the first year and a half of her life (my daughter is now 3 1/2, I'm 26). I have now been home for college for 2 years and see my daughter 4 to 5 times a week, always at my baby mama's place. My parents and my whole family have been telling me that I need to take my baby mama to court so that I can bring her around the family more often. They don't get to see her much because my baby mama works (she works a job that allows her to bring our daughter with her) and says she doesn't have time to see my parents. So, I listened to them and filed for a court custody hearing. Granted, this is after several arguments and her refusal to let me take our child, even for a couple hours.. I can't help but feel incredibly guilty about this because:\n\n1. I went behind her back and filed for this custody hearing.

She's absolutely terrified that I'm going to lose track of my daughter and she's going to find her way to our pool and drown.\n2.

I waited for a couple of minutes to see if anyone wanted the seat, then sat down and opened Hearthstone. In front of me were an old lady and a 20yo man who mentioned that he had an accident with his motorcycle and hurt his legs.\n\nFor 10 minutes, everything was fine. I managed to win a couple of games and was enjoying myself. Then, another old lady entered from the back. Since the bus was full, she had trouble getting in and someone offered her a seat.

Can't you see there's others in need of the seat?\n(I actually looked and there were no elderly people around. There were some middle aged people, but I thought that if they needed the seat, say they got tired or their backs hurt, they would ask for it.

Don't -\n\nOL: You shouldn't even sit down, these seats aren't for young people!\n\nAt this point I was furious because I'm not used to being yelled up by strangers, but someone from the back was waving at me to let it go and not reply, so I stayed silent and focused on the game until the OL\n stopped as well.

Last year we were sharehousing with another couple (21F, 21F). \n\nI used to be friends with the other couple who will be referred to as N and D. During our time sharing, our friendship sort of broke down. They treated my boyfriend very badly, told me I was too good for him, and were consistently hypocritical in what they expected him to do, vs what they would do (e.g. they wanted him to clean the lounge when it was their stuff, they would expect him to do things that they wouldn't do, clean the showers, etc) . \n\nBefore we moved in, I was very close with N, and after we moved out, I was willing to give her another chance as a friend, with the understanding that she could dislike my partner, but any negative thoughts she had about him would be kept to herself or I'd leave. \n\nI also said I'd try to mend our friendship, but she'd still not be welcome in my house, simply because my partner is not comfortable with her being in his home, and I side with him (my logic is that he pays rent, so he gets a say in who comes in our home). \n\nHowever, our wider friendship circle (who we kept out of the conflict because we didn't want them to feel like they had to choose sides) has started to comment on the fact that I never invite N to our hangouts and called me an ass. \n\nI feel like I'm respecting my partner's boundaries and his wishes about who comes in the house that he helps pay for. \n\nSo Reddit, AITA for not letting someone that makes my partner uncomfortable in our shared home?

It just felt natural with me. \n\nUntil I entered creative writing class as an elective this year. I slowly started to notice everyone else was better than me and got really discouraged. I was debating whether or not to hand an assignment in when my friend, who I met in an English class last year asked to read my stuff.\n\nSo I reluctantly let her and another of our classmates read it. They praised the story. They offered criticisms of course, which I explicitly asked for. Multiple times. I even said that they should tell me if it’s straight up awful and I’ll just scrap the whole thing and start again. But no they said they liked it a lot and that it was clear, easy to read, and original. \n\nSo I trusted them and handed it in. After all, they’re better writers than me and must know what they’re talking about, right?\n\nWell either they didn’t or they lied to my fucking face. I bombed that assignment. Not only that, but the prof basically wrote in the notes section that completely went against what they said. While they said it was easy to read, clear, and original, the prof, (being an author himself) said it was clichéd, illogical, and incredibly confusing. He also said it doesn’t even sound like the writer know what he’s writing about. \n\nIt’s not the fact that he wrote that that gets me. It’s that my friend outright lied to my face. When I asked her to tell me how awful it is, if it is, multiple times. And I told her several times when we met for lunch and stuff that lying is by far the worst offence you could do to me. Aside from doing extreme things like killing my whole family and shit like that. But you get the point right? \n\nI hate being lied to. All my friends know this. I don’t care if the truth hurts. I need it. Because when I don’t hear it, I go and I embarrass myself. I feel deeply hurt and betrayed because I trusted what she was saying was true. I feel like an idiot.

I was able to pay off my student loans from my BA early, and I'm completely financially independent. My needs are met, plus a little extra fun money and a vacation fund I manage to meet my goal on every year. I actually love the pace of it and always having twelve different deadlines to meet, I find it very invigorating. Honestly, everything about my job is perfect except for the way that people perceive it. I've gotten a lot of reactions along the lines of \"Oh, really? That's not what I would expect from you,\" probably because I am an outspoken feminist and people don't expect me to be in a job that's considered \"women's work,\" especially one where there is the perception that I am subservient to a male attorney. *I* know my job is more than making appointments and fetching coffee (not that there's anything wrong with that either,) but I have to admit that these little digs get to me. I've got pages of information on law school bookmarked even though I'm certain I don't want to be a lawyer. Usually it's enough for me to be happy with myself, but it absolutely stinks to be told repeatedly that I should be doing \"more.\"\n\nAnyway. One of my lunch buddies is an attorney and a couple of months ago he said he had a friend who would be great for me. I met him for coffee and we hit it off like I had never done before with anyone, and within a couple of weeks of the best dates and conversation I've had in my life, we decided to date exclusively. And my new boyfriend is, you guessed it, an attorney.\n\nHe doesn't even work at my firm, but the optics are terrible. And let me tell you that people have not been shy at all about pointing it out. One woman in document services told me I can quit and be a housewife now that I've \"pulled one.\" I've been asked how short a skirt I had to wear to get his attention. I know for a fact that there's been plenty of talk going around of me being a gold digger. Worst of all, someone started a rumor that I trade oral sex for longer breaks. Even my own mother told me that maybe now I should think of quitting and getting into \"a more family-oriented mindset.\"\n\nI don't want to give up on this relationship because my boyfriend is truly amazing. I know it's early, but I want to see where this goes. He's got a kindness to him that is so modest and genuine, and has such a wonderful outlook on life, and I feel like our personalities complement each other a lot because I am more bombastic while he is a bit softspoken, and I just...really like him. And knowing that people see me as a gold-digger who hikes up her skirt to get attention from some sleazy attorney absolutely kills me. I don't want people to think that I \"pulled an attorney.\" I don't want to have to deal with the sideways glances and whispers that stop the second that I enter the room. Part of me wants to end it while it's still early so there will be as little hurt as possible. I don't want to be two years into this relationship and be dying inside because I'm \"that girl\" at work.

My neighbor who I only know in passing asked me if he could park in my driveway since I don't use it. He doesn't have one. They have a family of 5 and I'm just on my own, so why not save them some money? I agreed.\n\nAnyways, in September I finally got my own wheels and made mention to my neighbor I need the driveway now.

He stopped using it.\n\nFor a little while at least. Many times I'd find his car in my driveway over the last several months, at least once a week. I had to use street parking in the interim. I would knock on his door, even get in touch with his landlord, and either get no response or a \"I'll sort it out\" which leads nowhere.\n\nTo get to the point, two days ago my neighbor parked in my driveway.

Generally, our relationship is pretty good - we rarely fight and our life together is fulfilling in all aspects except our sex life. Like most relationships, we started off having sex once a day, but that quickly tapered off. Around the 6 month mark she informed me that she does not enjoy sex that much, and would prefer it to occur around once a week. I would like it to be more frequent than this, but I respected her wishes and I generally initiate once a week. \n\nHowever, throughout our relationship she has enjoyed using her vibrators/dildos without me (yes, I have asked to use it on her and she has turned me down) 3-4x a week. I don't have a problem with this necessarily - of I course I wish she was using that energy with me, but I get that sometimes people can be in the mood for masturbating and not sex. I watch porn regularly and she doesn't like it, but hasn't explicitly asked me to stop. \n\nThat leads us to the issue -  recently, I purchased a sex doll for my own use. It has a face, but it is clear that it is not a real human. I enjoy it more because, for me, it feels more real. However, gf freaked out and told me to get rid of it. I feel like this isn't fair to me - I spent a good chunk of money on it and its not exactly returnable, and to me it seems like its basically the same as the toys she uses. After all, she has a dildo and it certainly isn't shaped like my dick. \n\nAITA for not wanting to get rid of this?

We have spent a lot of time with David over the past year as he was getting over a breakup, and I have come to really care for him as a person. We finally talked David into using the app that Charles and I met on just to get back out there, and after a few dud dates, 2 months ago David found a girl he seemed really excited about. Charles and I were super happy and excited to be able to double date and not make David feel like the third wheel. From what David told us, she was awesome and I was happy to possibly make a close female friend (of which I’m lacking in this town because I have moved around a ton in the past few years). \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAs you might expect, meeting her (Abby) went much differently than expected. Charles and I invited them on a double date to dinner and an arcade, and I spent the entire time feeling like *we* had intruded on *their* date. She constantly interrupted me and Charles, always had to 1-up our comments, and the only time she addressed me directly, it was to tell me why a game I like is stupid. She didn’t ask a single thing about me or Charles, though we made an effort to ask her about her life. She’s not shy, either. Our server accidentally got the wrong kind of light beer, and instead of wasting it, I just decided to drink it and clarify when I ordered another. Abby kept repeating that I didn’t get what I ordered and for me to give it to her so she could go get the right beer. No amount of “no really. It’s fine.” affected her, and she ended up snatching it out of my hand (already half empty) and marched over to the waitress. She’s also obsessed with her “connections” to some local bars/restaurants, and feels the need to drop that into nearly every conversation, even if we were NOT talking about that. She’s obsessed with being older than Charles and I, frequently dropping things like “oh, you’re too young to know what ___ is” when I was in the middle of commenting on that very thing. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWe have hung out a few more times but each time seems to get worse. I have a holiday birthday known for drinking, and Charles and I invited them to come out with us to celebrate, being very clear that if they wanted to primarily celebrate the holiday or had other plans, that we would have dinner some other night. Abby insisted that she would use her connection to get us a rather expensive table at a bar. Well, most of the night it was just me, Charles, and David at the table because Abby had run off to other parts of the bar with her friends that she had invited to my birthday celebration (important later). Charles and I would have left to do our own thing, but David would have been left alone, so we stayed and hung out with him. When it was time to go home, we had to get an UberXL on a holiday night because her friends needed a ride too (surprise!) so we waited forever and spent much more $$ than I expected. While working out the Uber arrangements, David and Charles got into a disagreement about getting an UberXL or 2 Ubers. I’ve seen them do this kind of thing many times before, I told them both to stop arguing and that we’d deal with the money in the morning, and to just order the xl. Abby did not like what I said, and walked over to her friend to call me a bitch and complain that I don’t know David and shouldn’t be telling him what to do (all obviously loud enough for me to hear). \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBasically, I find her incredibly off-putting, rude, and I just don’t enjoy spending time with her. Charles is a bit more forgiving (and I think is afraid of losing his brother), but he would rather not hang out with her either. David continues to ask if we want to hang out, and is starting to notice that we have backed off from double dates. I don’t want to stop Charles from seeing them, and I don’t avoid things like Christmas where everyone is around just because she’s going, but I kind of feel like an asshole for “causing a problem” now that David seems happier.

I can’t really remember the whole conversation, I was really anxious during the whole thing so it’s kind of a blur. She basically asked me what my feelings for my ex were, and I said it’s complicated, but yes I do still love her.

Two of them (we're going to call them Hannah and Jack) have been bff's for most of that time. Naturally, they're the only ones who never realized they were in love with each other. We all decided to kind of stay out of the drama and them them work it out for themselves.\n\nStarting about a year and a half ago, we all *finally* thought they were about ready to hook up. They'd rented a house together, got a dog. *Eventually* they were going to figure it out, right? Along comes \"Jasmine\".\n\nJasmine isn't a bad person, per say, just emotionally immature and selfish. She can be very kind, and is bluntly honest, which I generally like in a human. Jack and Jasmine met through tinder and were both supposedly only looking for a FWB. But she pressured Jack into a more commited relationship than he was ready for, never really tried to become friends with the rest of the group (most of us have S.O.'s that have integrated just fine), and then complained that we were mean and cliquey and were trying to take Jack away from her. ... Naturally, her biggest issue was with Hannah from day one. Jasmine was consistently trying to drive a wedge in between them, to the point she tried to secretly move in with them for a while. (Thank goodness Jack saw through at least *that*.)\n\nThree months ago, Jack went to Jasmine's to talk to her about the trouble she was causing with the rest of us. We all thought he was going to break up with her. Imagine our surprise when he shows up a few days later to the pub saying they'd run off to Vegas to get *married*. \n\nHannah was a mess, but tried to keep it together and be as nice to Jasmine as possible. Jack, to his credit, did draw a line in the sand that Jasmine had to back off a bit, and for the most part the drama calmed down. \n\nA couple of weeks ago, Jack and Jasmine got into a huge fight and Jack went over to Hannah's to have a  drink and cool off (a bunch of us were already there). When we left, they were on the back porch talking and smoking. Apparently, some time after that, they hooked up. Multiple times. And it looks like it's going to become a regular thing until Jack leaves Jasmine. \n\nIt was wrong of Jack to cheat on Jasmine, I know that. But Jasmine saw what was happening between Jack and Hannah when she first started dating him, she just decided to disregard it and take what she wanted. When she finds out she's going to be crushed.

And I love fun, but my career comes first. I want to go into economics. So I emailed local econ professors, financial firms, etc, asking if I could help out and do an internship. I know it's a long shot, but I am a bit of a math whiz- I've taken honors algebra 1 and 2, honors geometry, precalc, and ap calc and am now taking ap stats as a freshman- and am taking AP Macroecon, so I hoped there was some chance.

Recently broke up with Ex (it was a nice breakup so like no hard feelings) and there was a party soon. Was @school when I get a message off F1 saying \"OLG is gonna try and come onto you at the party\". I had never thought of OLG like that &amp; I was a little surprised.\n\nI'd never actually seen her in person. On insta, she was hot. I thought might as well pop-up and get to know her, as friends. We started talking on Wednesday and the party was Saturday. I never made the conversation sexual. I had a rave on Friday.\n\nMain Body\n\nHer convo was dead so I thought I'd just speak on Saturday.\n\nNow, on pills, I get stupidly confident and the result is I pull more girls than normal. This did result in me taking a girl back to an airbnb and sleeping with her. It was all consensual and we both had fun so I didn't see an issue here (I still speak to the girl as a friend).\n\nI left the airbnb at like 12:00, when the owners said we had to leave and went straight home and slept till 19:00 meaning for the afternoon, I was unable to respond to messages. I thought any normal human would understand. I wake up to a stupid amount of missed calls and messages from a number not saved in my contacts. I read the messages and deduced it was OLG. I sent a message saying something like \"Hey, sorry, I was sleeping, see you later :)\". Nothing flirty.\n\nI get to this party at like 21:00 and everyone is already fucked up so I start drinking. I see F1 and F2 and they rush straight over and tell me how OLG has been chatting shit about how I lead her on and then didn't answer her calls. I'm tipsy at this point and really didn't care. I had saved the snap messages so I could prove I didn't lead her on. Then one of our mutual friends comes over (a female) and goes all Karen on me saying I'm a dickhead and that I should 'give her a chance'. I thought to myself, a girl likes me, I might as well give it a try.\n\nI don't approach her for a little while but when I do, I realise HOLY FUCK SHE'S NOT WHAT SHE LOOKS LIKE IN THE PICTURES! It's too late though. She see's me and goes \"omg hiiiiiiii! Where have you been hiding all night?!\". I start doing small talk but keep it all non-flirty as to make sure I don't give off the wrong impression. Me, F1 and F2 have a signal that basically means 'get me the fuck out of here'. It's literally just getting eye-contact and opening your eyes wide at them. F1 rushes over and gives some shitty excuse as to why I need to come with him to another room and yay I get to stop talking to OLG.\n\nI talk to F1 and F2 about how she's a massive catfish and they agree.

Everyone in the family knows that. She can barely keep a job (I think. I've never seen her in work close the entire time I knew her), She steals, she lies, and she was just a bad example when I was younger. Now I understand people talk about blood is thicker than water but I don't care. Even if you're family, If you fuck me over or play me, I will cut ties. Multiple incidents occured when my aunt decided to visit on many occasions. One I vividly remember is the day my dad came home angry. I was in high school so lets say like 15 or 16. I asked him what had happened. Apparently my aunt asked my mother for the pin to the EBT card because she wanted just a little food. My mother gave it to her. Not surprising to me she spent pretty much like $200 or more on groceries even though she just wanted a few things. My dad was pissed and so was my mother. My aunts response: You should have never given me the pin. \nWtf? \nShe gave you the pin because you asked to get A LITTLE food. Not feed you for the next month or two while we haven't even gone grocery shopping yet. The next incident was a couple weeks before me and my dad moved. I love animals. At the time I had a cat that I named Noah. He was the love of my life and everyone knew that. Now I dont remember what started the little argument. There was no yelling. I remember having an attitude because of something she said and I WALKED AWAY FROM HER. I wasn't in the mood to argue. Then she came up to my dads room where I was sitting and said: \"blah blah blah. You need to get over it. You ain't gonna have your cat for long anyways so say goodbye\".\nI fucking snapped and I told her off and made her cry. I didn't care. I knew I probably would be able to bring him and I was already upset about it. Now you want to make me feel worse. That ain't gonna happen. I would also like to add that one day she let him outside and I NEVER SAW HIM AGAIN! I didn't get to say goodbye auntie. When we finally left, I didn't say goodbye to her and I haven't spoken to her since.\nThis is getting long but I am going to keep going.\nNow my mother. She...is okay. I mean if I had a choice I would obviously choose my dad over my mother. She wasn't really there for me. She drinks until she passes out. She also can't hold down a job or an apartment. She never has her own money and when she borrows, she pretty much never pays it back. She goes to jail more than anyone I have ever known. She does and sells drugs, another reason she ends up in jail. She choose horrible boyfriends. I've had much more fond memories of my father taking care of me when I was sick, coming to my rotc competitions, getting me my first pet, helping me with prom, college, drivers test, etc. When I think of my mother, I can remember the times she obviously took my money without asking, her drunk, her making a scene on a bus for literally no reason, asking for money, yelling, and more. I should love my mother but I can't say i do. I mean she can say I love you and kiss me but I remember always just saying I love her back and then wiping my cheek when she wasn't looking. She always ended up disappointing me in one way or another. Not coming to my high school graduation, getting put in jail the day before my archery competition, just not showing up period. It gets tiresome. Now she is in jail. We haven't spoken in a couple of years. I really don't want to speak with her. I know she is going to just end up in jail again as she always does and I am just left here with people asking me \"How is your mom doing?\" And having to tell them in jail and their response be \"What she do this time?\".

Apparently there was a hardware update on her PlayStation that’d been going all day and I stopped it. \n\nI got into a huge fight with them about “not fucking with her all the time”, which pretty much ended with me telling them both to go fuck off, and that I’d start throwing genuine insults around the house to see what they think about it.

I had been seeing this girl for about 3 months, the last month and a half we have been spending almost every day together, she would stay at my house or I would stay at her house 3-4 days a week, so I had just assumed that we were exclusive and that the conversation defining our relationship was soon to come.\n\tHer birthday was a week ago and she was having a birthday party that weekend to celebrate it. She asked me to come over and help make some food for the party, so I arrived at her house a few hours before the party had started. I had just assumed I would be spending the night over there since we hadn’t seen that much of each other (besides on her birthday we went out to dinner and had a great time) that week because of the holidays, so I brought a bag with a change of clothes and a toothbrush, ect.  So I helped her set up for the party and her friends and co-workers start to arrive. This was my first time meeting a lot of her friends and the night was going really good. It was a small party maybe 10-15 people, her friends all seemed really cool. The whole night she had been giving me a lot of attention (sitting on my lap, holding my hand, taking me aside to kiss) until her co-worker “bob” showed up. As soon as he walked in the door she got really excited ran over to him and gave him a big hug. After this point she began to completely ignore me and was pretty much hanging off of “bob”. She had introduced me to all her friends before bob had arrived but after he arrived she was just all over him.\n\tI try not to get jealous, but watching this person who I care about flirting with someone else can really get to you. after about an hour of her ignoring me and flirting with this other guy I was starting to get angry, so I stepped outside to have a smoke. From the front porch you can see into the living room and I watched her and bob go over to the couch and she sat in his lap and began to kiss him. At this point I was pretty drunk and very angry, so I called an uber went inside to grab my back pack and as I was at the front door she came over to me and asked were I was going and I yelled at her “I’M FUCKING DONE WITH YOU, GO BACK TO  BOB!” and went home.\n\tThat night I received a bunch of calls and texts from her calling me an asshole and that I ruined her birthday party, I didn’t respond to her. The next morning I called her and told her I was going to come over and get my car if she wanted to talk. When I got there we talked and she said that she didn’t feel like she did anything wrong because we had never talked about being exclusive and that I was overreacting. I pretty much told her that I guess it was my mistake for assuming we were exclusive but what she did was still fucked up and that we are still over. This past week I have been receiving messages from her and her roommate calling me a piece of shit for ruining her birthday party, and that I am over reacting. Maybe I shouldn’t have yelled at her in front of people but I feel that making out with someone in front of the person you are dating is an asshole move.\n\nTD;DR: girl I was dating made out with her co-worker at her birthday party so I broke up with her in front of her friends.\n",

I share them with a friend, and she shares hers with me so I don't have to make one for every class, and I made one for our last Chemistry Exam. I didn't have much time the weekend or the days before the exam, so I wasn't sure I knew everything and minutes before the test I'm anxiously reading through this printed-out summary I made, and this guy walks up to me and asks me a question. I already know I'm not going to know the answer and interrupt him, saying that I don't know, and continue to read my summary. He then grabs the paper and yanks it out of my hands. \n\nMe: \"Uhm, what the heck?\"\n\nHe: \"I'm just looking for the answer, I need it right now\"\n\nMe: \\*getting upset bc this isn't the first time and I don't know shit for this exam\\* \"Yeah, well I need it too. And it's mine, I worked hours on this, I want to read through it now because I don't know everything either, and you didn't even ask. Give it back to me.\n\nHe: \"I just need to loo it up\"\n\nMe: \"The exam literally starts in like two minutes, we don't have the time to both look through the whole thing. I need it, you can't just take my stuff! Give it back to me now!\" \\*grabs it back\\*\n\nHe: \"Wtf chill I just wanted to look for the answer to my question\"\n\nI then ignored him and proceeded rereading everything. It wasn't like I was looking through the page that he wanted to read too, then we both could have looked at it. I wanted to finish the part I started reading then, because I couldn't remeber the stuff there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for not letting him read through my notes?

Lets call the junior manager \"Cruella\".\n\nMy uncle is an asshole and that is why none of his children help in running the company- they all work outside the country away from him. My uncle controls all power in the organisation and micromanages everything.  However, he is old and has only me to leave the company to. I mention all this because I have reported the problems that Cruella causes and my uncle does not do anything because she is his favorite. I also do not have the power to fire her until few weeks from now when my uncle's retirement date comes up.\n\nI have 3 managers under me and Cruella is the only one out of them who disobeys my orders, especially if it means that she has to work for me. My uncle gave her control of a division of the company that is very new and profitable, and this has gotten to her head. She refuses to give reports that would help us maximize efficiency and profits in the division. She only gives reports when she feels like. The irony is that when she needs help and has exhausted all options, she runs to me. I have cautioned her numerous times but she never cooperates knowing that only my uncle has the final decision and power to punish her. \n\nMy uncle covers for her because he wrongly thinks that she is making the profit for the division she controls. She gets her staff working like clockwork and she works hard. However, she costs the company about 30 cents on every dollar of profit as her delayed reports deprives us from adjusting on time to certain costs. The issue here is that she did not set up the division- I and my uncle did. She also is not good with numbers as I have to correct her reports consistently.\n\nTo show you how nasty Cruella can be, she even got rude to my uncle's oldest son (my cousin). Can you imagine that she had the nerve to try to remove my uncle's son (who is a silent partner and technically her boss) from a staff meeting? Of course, my uncle covered it up and apologised to my cousin for her. That was when I decided that I would fire her when I have the power. Also, my cousin gave me his blessing to fire her after that incident as he was pissed with both my uncle and Cruella. \n\nCurrently, I am thinking of firing her and not giving her either a severance pay or her would-be last month pay.  I truly want to punish her for being insubordinate and for abusing the favour that my uncle has shown her. The funny thing is that we are in a country that has very weak labour laws.

This place is part of the museum/library in my city, and as such, often holds art exhibits.\n\nApparently, the new exhibit is some really left-wing political thing, with posters about \"masculinity\", \"intersectionalism\" and other stuff, which logically shouldn't be allowed there, since this youth center is municipally owned, and is considered an apolitical space, meaning that the youth centre is not allowed to endorse or promote political stances. Despite these rules, the whole place was plastered in left-wing propaganda shit, including a whole section on Karl Marx and class struggles.\n\nSo me and my friends, who run the spectrum from left wing feminists to anti-immigration rightwingers, all joined in and started making fun of the posters, reading them out loud to each other and mocking the exhibit.

I am married with a child on the way, and between family and work obligations I probably only play a few hours of games a week compared to the 2-3 hours a night I was playing several years ago.  This isn't a big deal for me as games just aren't the priority they used to be, but the rest of my gaming buddies still play almost as much as we did as kids.  They are all a bit younger than I am and have plenty of free time and disposable income to dedicate to the hobby.\n\nAs a result of all this my skills at games have dropped off while they are all still very skilled at the games we play resulting in me losing every single game we play so hard I might as well have not even bothered playing.  I am not bothered by losing.  Even when I was at my peak I was pretty average within this group so its not like I was winning all my games or anything, but I actually can't remember the last time I finished a game in the top 2/3rd of the scoreboard.  \n\nNow this hadn't been a major issue initially because we also played a lot of co-op and non competitive games like Rock Band, and some others which was great, but lately the group's focus has been on competitive games.  Primarily they want to play some old school shooters and the new Smash Bros.  Well for context for those that know Smash over the course of 10 matches I only managed to take 5 stock off my opponents in total.  They obliterated me so completely that by the end of the last match I just wanted to jump off the map so I could end the game quicker and save us all the time watching me get beaten to death.\n\nRealizing I wasn't having any fun I started asking around to see if maybe we could play some less competitive games, but the group as a whole really wanted to keep playing those games for now.  I totally get it.  If they are having fun I have no right to demand a change just for my sake.   I sent the following message in the discord for the group of 12 players as a result.\n\n*\"Hey guys I'd like to sit out the next meetup since there will mostly just be Smash and CS being played as I'm just not having as much fun playing the competitive games like I used to.  I can't really keep up and play them very well.  I'd still love to join you guys later on when there are more co-op or casual games to play though.*\n\nA few members were understanding about it, but a couple of the others started messaging me asking me to keep going and to stop being a sore loser.  I tried to explain to them that it wasn't about losing, but about the extent to which I was losing and that I wasn't having fun basically being a punching bag for everybody in game all night long.  I was then accused of being overly dramatic and immature because I can't handle not winning all the time.\n\nSo am I the asshole here?  I kinda see why they think I'm a sore loser, but I just don't see it that way.  I still lost a lot back when I was good at the games, but at least then I was keeping up with people and able to play the games and have fun.

SHE WORKED SO HARD ON THAT!\"\n\nNot knowing what was going on I stepped over to see what the commotion was all about. This was the first time I had seen or heard of the scrap book, and was unaware of its contents until I witnessed my girlfriend removing all of the pictures that displayed my ex-wife. She was even throwing away pictures that didnt include me and were of my daughter and her mother only.\n\nI abruptly put an end to the destruction, and have been on non-speaking terms with my girlfriend since the event. (8 hours ago) I have tried to explain that I dont want the pictures for myself, and have even stored the in the garage in a box that I keep with all of my daughters report cards and neat school projects and art. However, my wife thinks we should destroy all evidence of my ex, even though her current leave of absence is not guaranteed to be  permanent. \n\nShe was raised similarly and I asked her how she would feel if her stepmother threw away all pictures of her biological mother, just because she moved. She agreed that she would be upset, but argued that it doesnt matter now that SHE is the one raising my daughter. \n\nI'm so lost as to why she thinks this is ok. It's like jealousy and ego have gotten the beat of her and her true self has disappeared. I'm so dumbfounded by it that I'm not certain that I'm not seeing this clearly. Am I missing something?  AITA?\n\nTLDR- my girlfriend doesnt want any pictures of her stepdaughter's mother in the house (anywhere, even in storage) because she is raising my daughter, and bio mother doesnt deserved to be remembered.",

My parents thought it was the teachers as she (apparently) has dyslexia (never been officially diagnosed but she shows alot of signs, so understandable). After doing alot of school searching and hopping, my parents were somewhat angry that no school they desired would take her (they obviously went after ones with high reviews, however the only ones with placements left were more...undesirable), so they put her into a private school, costing around 600$ per month, in the hopes that she gets more 1-on-1 time and help with her work, due to overall lesser amount of classmates and the like. I was obviously annoyed by this, but their defense was that I have never struggled with grades (Which is true) and never needed any help with work. This wasn't helped by the fact that they changed after 2 weeks at the new private school, and chose an even more expensive private school afterwards, which is almost double, at 1200$ a month. While I understand that she needs more help than I do, I can't help but feel tossed to the side as my sister gets this special education I wasn't allowed. I still think I would benefit If I went to private school at this stage, but of course my parents deny it, claiming that my grades are good enough that it wouldn't benefit me.

She was very vocally against this saying \"we are supposed to be for women, not people like that, they know what they are getting into and deserve everything they get.\" One of the other volunteers spoke up about how often sex workers were assaulted, she said that she doesn't care and repeated that they knew what they were getting into, and that it took away from real assault victims like \\*\\*her\\*\\*. At this point I spoke up saying that I was feeling attacked as she just blamed me for my assault. She immediately back peddled and claimed that \"this is just my belief about \"those women\" and that she didn't mean \\*\\*me\\*\\*.nope, can't say sex worker and not mean me. She then said she has the right to her opinion, but I have to understand that she didn't mean it that way. She apologized for me \"taking her wrong\", it's BS and I'm not happy.During this meeting she also sais that she would never be able to give pro-choice info because its against her beliefs (not a religious belief, she's an atheist), she didn't know it but someone present had an abortion. She was reminded that in the mandate we are a pro-choice center and she can't try and bully people out of their decisions. She said once again that this is just her belief and that she should be allowed to have whatever belief she wants but she will just have to leave her beliefs at the door. As we were all leaving the school, she stops me in the main area and demands I forgive her and give her a hug in font of about 30 students, knowing that if I said no I would look like an asshole.\n\nI complained to the head of the center, but she is a student and doesn't have any control over anything. She brought it up to the school staff member that is in control of hiring and the budget, but so far nothing has been done about it.\n\nMy next step is to lodge a formal complaint against her. I been resistant in doing this because 1) I would have to come out as an ex-sex worker to more people and 2) I am a mature student in my 30's whereas she is in her early 20's and it kinda felt like complaining against a child\n\nShe has now applied to be head of the center and it looks like she'll get the job because sh'e manipulated the student union into backing her by saying we've discriminated against her by not allowing her beliefs (again not religious).\n\nI am very afraid that she is going to say something to someone who has been through those things when they have come for support. If was younger and still in sex work when she said that to me it would have devastated me and I probably would not feel safe at the school.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWill I be an asshole if I file a complaint against her?",

		"story": "Buckle up, I have no idea if this will make sense at all so bear with me.   \n\n\nContext: I'm 25F and so is my friend, I'll call her M for simplicity. We were best friends in high school but immediately after graduation we lost touch despite going to different colleges in the same city. This was due, for me at least, to the fact that our friend group had a lot of toxic drama that I was honestly happy to get away from after graduation and because college was my first real time of liberation where I spent 4 years exploring the world outside of our tiny high school and making friends with people from different countries and viewpoints. M and I started hanging out again and maintaining regular contact in our senior years, about 4 years ago now.   \n\n\nFor all 4 years of high school and for the first 2 years of college, I had a boyfriend who I'll call T. T was 2 years older than us but was integrated into our friend group. It took me a while to realize this, but T was extremely emotionally abusive to me. I could go on forever about the things he did, but to avoid writing a novel I'll just say that he performed textbook emotional abuse on me (and one time even physical as he thought it would absolutely hilarious to shoot me point blank with a BB gun and then laugh when I cried) that took me years to unlearn. Even today, there are times where the things he said and did to me impact my very happy, healthy relationship. He made my life an absolute hell before, during, and after our breakup and that shit stays with you even when you don't want it to sometimes, especially when you listened to someone consistently insult and degrade you during your most formative years.   \n\n\nNow, the issue: ever since \"reuniting\" with M, it has been made clear to me that she has maintained a friendship with T. At first, I didn't think that she was aware of the shit he did to me so I approached her (this was about 3 or 4 years ago now) and let her know that he abused me and suggested that I was really uncomfortable with her being friends with him.  She, along with some other friends of ours, agreed that he's just generally a really unpleasant person to be around and was horrified by some of the things he did to me so I figured that was that.   \n\n\nExcept, it wasn't. Periodically through the past 4 years I would hear through the grape vine about the fact that she was still maintaining a friendship with T and would talk to him in a group chat, invite him to outings and parties, etc. I would also hear about how he still bemoans our relationship and refers to me exclusively as \"bitch face\" when he is not spreading vicious rumors about me, 5 years later. Each time I would again approach her and express my discomfort and reiterate what he did to me and each time I was met with \"well, I feel bad for him because he doesn't have anything else going on in his life.\" And it's like, ....! Maybe he doesn't have anything going on in his life because he is just an unpleasant person!!! But I digress.  \n\n\nIn the past year/year and a half, I had barely heard of him until recently. I live across the country currently but informed M that I would be coming home for 2 weeks and asked to hang out. She told me that she was busy. I then found out that in fact she would be busy because she had invited T and some other friends to her apartment. This is when I started to get upset for real. I calmly approached her again and explained that I just feel extremely hurt and insignificant because I have continually expressed to her my discomfort over her relationship with T and she has repeatedly disregarded my feelings on the matter and then went and invited him to her place over me. She then turned it back on me, explaining that she was uncomfortable with me asking her to end her friendship with T because T reached out to her in college while I didn't. From there the conversation devolved into her telling me that she's an adult and can choose to be friends with whomever she chooses (true) as long as she's not hurting anyone (true) and that things are only this way because I did not speak to her for most of college (I did not speak to any of my high school friends for most of college, and none of them hold this against me because they understand that life happens) and because about 2 years ago I approached her with some concerns about her relationship with her current boyfriend (which she immediately corrected &amp; I accepted).   \n\n\nI understand that I have no control over who she chooses to be friends with. But she is making me out to be a horrible person because I have decided that for myself, personally, I cannot be friends with someone who maintains a relationship with my abuser -- however infrequent -- and then justifies that relationship to me by saying that it's all because he reached out in my absence. It is especially baffling to me because M is ultra-feminist to the point where she literally studies feminism for her doctorate so I just have a hard time understanding her desire to be friends with him in the first place. But I accept that if that's her decision, so be it, but for my own sanity I can't be friends with someone like that.   \n\n\nReddit, AITA?   \n\n\nTLDR: My friend from high school is still friends with my emotionally abusive ex boyfriend. I expressed that I can't be friends with someone who intentionally maintains a relationship with him and ignores my discomfort over the matter. Friend turns it back on me, saying that I'm being controlling, unhealthy, and insufferable and that her friendship to him is justified because ex-bf maintained contact with her during college whereas I did not.   \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

		"story": "I live in a house with three roommates and a two-car garage. We all pay the same amount of rent. Two of my roommates are a couple and have lived here since before I moved in. We will call them S and K. There are 4 cars to the household: S's, K's and my two cars (one of which is a convertible that I am selling and have moved to the suburbs to keep it off the city streets as registration has expired.) S &amp; K have been parking in the garage for the past 3 years/since I signed the lease. I have parked both of my cars on the street for the past 3 years.\n\nWhen I first moved in, I asked S about the garage parking deal. He replied that he and K paid extra for those spots. Well I had just recently discovered that they have never paid any extra monthly cost for those spots. If anything, they paid for two garage door openers at $30 each.\n\nLast week, while they were on vacation, I asked if I can park in the garage while they were gone. I now realize how fucking  amazing it is to have a garage spot in the city of Chicago especially in the dead of winter when it's about to be -20/-50 windchill for the next two days and snow all over the ground where street parking is extremely limited as the Chicago tradition of \"dibs\" lives on with vigor.\n\nAfter they got back, K asked me to move my car from the garage so she can park. Instead of moving my car, I asked if they would be willing to share the garage with me seeing as we all pay the same amount of rent. K told me that S needs his spot because all his heavy and expensive work equipment stays in his car. She then asked that she and S have a couple of days to discuss their options. I said sure and agreed to allow her to park while I was away at work the next day and overnight. A few hours later she asked for my work schedule, obviously with the intent of sharing her garage spot with me. I gave her my schedule.\n\nWhile I was at work the next day, I texted  her my schedule as requested (I realize I probably shouldn't have). She also said she would need the opener back as my suggestion of her sharing boyfriend's (S) would not work because she and he have different schedules. She also said that I would have to purchase a third garage door opener from the landlord. I said we can discuss the garage deal when I get home from work the next day.\n\nA lil about our schedules:\n I am a bartender who works late nights and usually stays at my boyfriend's until the next day after my late shift. She currently works from home along with S except for the times when he travels for the day or sometimes week. Sometimes for a day a week, a few days a week or for a whole week. But despite all of our schedules, I think it is my turn to have a garage spot for me and only me as long as I am in town. I am willing to let her park while I am gone but for her to move her car everytime I get back seems all so unrealistic to me.\n\nWell, I am home now and parking on the street while her car is still in the garage. I was hoping to have our discussion but she was busy on the phone and working from home. Then suddenly they were due to leave to go to a friend's house for a few hours. As much as I would love to park my car in one of their spots, I think that would be very rude as we had not had our discussion yet.\n\nJust as they were ready to leave, she asked if I had the garage door opener. I said yes but I would like to have a discussion with her about it when they get back. I realize I should have just given her the garage door opener seeing as she had paid $30 for it. But my instincts told me to hold onto it until we have our discussion. I'm pretty much holding it as collateral and I'm sure she knows this.\n\nAITA in this situation? \n\nI can see me being an asshole by not giving her back the garage door opener yet but I am willing to give her $30 for it as I intend to park in the garage for at least the next year. In fact, they claim they may move out in 4 months so it'll only be for that time that she will no longer be able to park her car in the garage. More so, I want to request that parking spot is for me and that we do not share it as she had it for the past three years.\n\nI feel like it was inconsiderate of them to not even give me the option to park in the garage since I have been living here. That it is inconsiderate of them while I walk a block or two home by myself with a knife and mace gripped tightly at 3 in the morning on some nights that I get off work from the bar. There are a lot of rapes and muggings in Chicago at night. Inconsiderate that I have to move both of my cars for street cleaning which I've received several hundreds of dollars in parking tickets for since living here (my fault, I know.) I feel they are being selfish. There was a time I had to jump start my car to move my out of the garage so one of them can park after they got back from a previous vacation. In fact, they never even offered for me to park my car while they were gone, not once until I asked. It seems they feel entitled to both spots because I don't know, it was theirs before I moved in? Becuase they are a couple/team? Becuase they paid $30 for each garage door opener? Are they entitled?\n \nI strive to be a generous and selfless person but I think sometimes this causes me to sell myself short as others walk all over me. \n\nThere's no way I'm the asshole... right, guys?",

		"story": "This post may be a bit long as the issue was the culmination of years of behavior that all came to a head the other night.\n\n**The Background**\n\nAt a very young age (about 8 or 9) I was already more tech savvy than anybody else in my family.  Shortly after this \"gift\" was discovered I became the go to person when anything computer related would have issues.  Now when I was a kid in the 90s and there were only a few computers between all my extended family this meant the occasional reboot, antivirus sweep, or OS reinstall a few times a year.  No big deal.  I was happy to help my family, and I was building a skillset that would land me a career in IT that I happen to enjoy very much.\n\nThe problems started about 8-10 years ago as more and more members of the family started getting computers, internet connections, and game consoles in all their homes.  Suddenly the standard greeting for my family was \"where is OP?  we've got some things we need him to look at while he's here.\"  So instead of joining in on the fun I would have a laptop, xbox, and a couple phones thrust into my arms as they went back into the other room to have fun.  As shitty as that sounds at that time in my life I still enjoyed learning about the tech and was still happy to help.  Just a bit less happy than before now that I was missing out on more of our family functions.\n\nSoon after this pattern began a few of my relatives started giving out my contact info to their friends and neighbors whenever they'd complain about some technical issue.  So I start getting texts and phonecalls several times a week from people who want me to drive out to their house and fix their stuff.  After a few times I actually started quoting rates for my services.  This caused some drama with a few of my relatives who claimed they were ashamed and embarrassed that I would dare try and charge for my time when all I did was \"hit a couple buttons and bam it works!\"  My response of \"if it is so easy then why don't you guys go do it?\" was met with silence for several weeks.\n\nAfter this I started to distance myself from these family gatherings and pushing back a bit on the tech support front by telling them they need to take it to a shop or something for more complicated issues.  This mean I would only be doing a few quick fixes and then I would join in on the party for the gatherings I chose to attend.  Sadly this was a temporary improvement as a few of my pushier relatives (the drama queens from the previous paragraph especially) demanded I take a closer look and \"stop being so lazy\" because they didn't want to pay a shop to look at their issues.  This was about 2 years ago and I simply told my parents I'd be going home and will no longer be coming to family events.  My father wasn't happy about it, but he seemed to understand and accepted my reasons.\n\n**On to the potential asshole event** \n\nFast forward to this weekend and my father is hounding me to go to an event at my grandfather's house.  It is my uncle's birthday and he specifically was asking if I'd be able to attend.  I was hesitant as I didn't want to deal with the drama from other attendees when I suddenly \"reappeared\" after 2 years.  Eventually they wore me down and I agreed to attend on the condition that I not be turned back into tech support for the day and simply left to enjoy the time with my family.  They both enthusiastically agreed so I went.\n\nHonestly the start of the party was great.  I got to see family that I had only briefly seen in the last 2 years, and I got to hang out with my grandfather and uncle both of whom are my favorite relatives to hang out with at these things.  I even got my uncle a couple bottles of his favorite beer that is pretty hard to find so he was pretty excited about that.\n\nUnfortunately this all came crashing down later in the evening when one of my drama queen aunt's was in a nearby room with my grandmother and a few of my female cousins.  I overheard the following said loudly enough that I know she knew I'd hear it.  \"Sure is a shame OP thinks he's too good to help his family with their computers now that he's a big shot IT nerd huh?  I brought my laptop just in case he decided to be an adult about this, but (my dad's name) said to just leave it in the car since he won't fix it.\"  (I know this isn't word for word since I lost some of it in my moment of rage, but it is pretty close I am fairly sure to what was said.  \"IT nerd\" was definitely used as that moment is burned into my memory now.)\n\nFull transparency here.  I lost my cool.  I know I should have just walked away, but I was seeing red here.  I stormed into the room and basically whisper yelled at her.  The basic breakdown because I only clearly remember the very end of my outburst here.\n\n\"I was this family's tech support bitch for almost a fucking decade.  It was fun when I was a kid, but after a few years of not getting to spend time with my family because you are too fucking dumb to take care of  your devices I was sick of it.  I was sick of you giving random people my number thinking I would spend my limited free time fixing their shit too.  I came out to spend time with (Uncle, and Grandfather) not to spend that time sitting in the garage working on your piece of shit laptop.  (Aunt) you are a massive entitled cunt, and I hope I never have to see your disgusting face ever again.\"  I then grabbed my things and went home ignoring the barrage of texts and calls I received for a few hours following my exit.\n\nThe aftermath is that though most of my family can sympathize with how I have been treated, and even got some apologies for past behavior...a good chunk of my family including my grandfather say I should apologize for the outburst even if I was in \"the right\" on it.  I disagree, but I am not really upset at them for thinking that.  I've been accused a few times of ruining my uncle's birthday which I apologized to him for.  And he seemed to accept the apology and still wants to hang out with me outside of family things so I am happy to hear that.\n\nProblem is I can't help this nagging feeling that I was way out of line for going off on her.  Like I know her behavior was shitty, but was my response a few steps too far?  Should I have just said a few quick goodbyes and gotten the hell out of there instead?  I honestly don't know now.",

It's common knowledge that she has strong feelings for me, but I'm more on the fence. Sunday we hung out, and I realized I didn't like her company. Something about her, and what she was talking about just annoyed me.\n\nWe said goodbye, and when I got home I basically wrote her a message basically saying I need space indefinitely and that if she sees me I don't want to talk to her. I said I had some issues to soften the blow, since I basically told her, and intended to mean that I don't really ever want to talk to her again, even though I'm doing great. \n\nI also made no secret of that I was still gonna be hanging out with basically everyone else I know, and that I'd be going to the same places me and her usually go to. I lied to get her off my back, since just saying \"piss off, leave me alone\" would be pretty rude, even if that was basically my whole point. \n\nI said I'd talk to her when the \"issues\" were resolved, but tbh I don't enjoy her company anymore, and I'm probably not gonna talk to her ever again, especially since I'm busy with work, and just went on my first date with another girl today.\n\nAm I the asshole for lying so she would leave me alone without any discussion, so I could focus on another girl I like, work and because she's starting to annoy me, and I don't want to speak to her anymore?",

In hindsight the engagement was impulsive and basically a last ditch effort to save the relationship. Predictably, things didn’t work out. She gave me back the ring. (She literally had the things for like two weeks and barely wore it). \n\nI initially planned to sell or pawn the ring. I don’t know why I didn’t. I just kept  postponing it and it never got done. \n\nFast forward to now. I have an amazing girl that I’m completely in love with. We talked a lot about marriage. The only issue is that I’m having to be a lot more careful with my money. She also wants to have a baby relatively soon so there’s that to consider. \n\nI decided that I already have a ring that’s basically in new condition. I still could have sold or pawned it. But my now-fiancée and I had talked about rings and stuff as well and this was really close to what she said she wanted. So I don’t know. I guess I romanticized it in my mind thinking “this is the girl that should have had it all along.”  Maybe that’s stupid, I don’t know. \n\nAnyway I proposed with it. What I didn’t realize was that my ex actually follows my fiancée on Instagram (why, I do not know!) and so she saw the ring. She, being the lovely person that she is, goes and DMs my fiancée to say that she thinks that’s the same engagement ring she got. \n\nMy fiancée confronts me all upset. I was honest and told her what happened. I immediately offered to buy another ring but she wasn’t having it. She even said she needs to think about whether she still wants to get married. That stung, as you can imagine, and I’m hoping (praying) she was just talking out of anger. \n\nHonestly, my ex moved like two states away after we broke up. I never expected them to get in contact with each other or I would never have put my fiancée in this position. Again, I love this woman to death.\n\nI mean, is this really the worst thing in the world? And bad enough to get possibly dumped over??",

Something normal to do, if you give a used device to somebody else, especially a kid, isn’t it? So after he finished that, I wrapped it up nicely, added some chocolate and sent it to my brother-in-law’s place by mail, as we live in opposite sides of the country.\n\nOn the night before Nicolaus day my brother-in-law calls my husband while we were driving home from evening grocery shopping. (So I was able to listen to the whole conversation as the car took the call.) My brother-in-law yells at my husband for resetting the device. ‘All the games for the boy are gone! The boy wants to play right away!’ My husband asks why he is not just downloading the games again from the play store? ‘It’s not working! Fix the problem NOW!’ But we’re driving. My husband tells his brother he can’t do anything right now. He should try to download the games another time.\n\nA bit later that night - we were just having dinner - my brother-in-law calls again and my husband didn’t pick up the phone as he wanted to have dinner in piece after a long day at work. That lead my brother-in-law to leave a very rude, aggressive voice message, telling my husband that he ruines his son’s life. And that he would send the iPad back to us on our expenses if my husband didn’t fix the problem at once. Later that night my husband writes him a message. Just a short research online - turns out that the play store was a bit busy and slow that night. He told him that and that he is tired of just hearing complaints about how he acts as godparent. That he is thinking to just let that rest, because apparently he can’t do anything right. So Christmas won’t be any presents from us.\n\nA few months before that iPad incident, we had sent the boy a birthday card with money which had got lost or stolen in the mail. We then transferred the money to their bank account a day late. So we’re really horrible people! Previous presents we chose were not the right ones. Either the wrong toy (lego instead of playmobil) or too small, I guess, because ‘the boy wants to save up some money to get something good. So just send cash.’ We also refused to travel all the way through Germany to attend the boys first school day celebration. We really didn’t feel like a stressful two days trip for hundreds of dollars right before my work started again for a lunch and a picture. We both have demanding jobs. Instead we bought all the school books the boy needed. But we always hear about us not being there for the first school day. (BTW: My brother-in-law and his second wife didn’t come to our wedding because of his work. They never visited us at our house. And if they ever come to my in-laws’ house, it’s because they payed the trip for them). And I received some very rude messages from that boys mother blaming me for ruining the boy’s first school day.\n\nSo the day after Christmas my husband gets this text message from his sister-in-law. She tells him that we’re pathetic to take out the argument with his brother on the boy. That he is mean to not sent him a Christmas present. She also demanded from my husband to ‘call the boy and tell him in person why he doesn’t have a godfather anymore’ - which my husband didn’t do. He is really tired of his brother and his crazy (ex)wives.\n\nBut seriously: Are we mean for ending that drama? Is there a way to keep contact with a 7 year old child without having to deal with his crazy parents? I honestly don’t see a way to separate the relationship of my husband with his youngest nephew from that with his brother. Apart from that my mother-in-law just told us on Christmas that the other godmother of the boy already broke off contact with them a while ago as they got into a fight with her too.\n\nNow I’m a bit worried because the 70th birthday of my father-in-law is coming up next month. And probably my brother-in-law will also be there. He has a bad temper - obviously. And he started yelling at his grandmother’s funeral a few years ago when his ex-wife showed up to pick up his two older sons.

Both of these have worked since they left school, have been tax payers, and are nose to the grind stone type of people since they started working (also neither of them went to college and come from skill labour / property admin jobs). I'm currently a college/university student who due a scholarship and student finance (based on my own financial situation), I don't have to work to support my studies.   \n   \n   \nA bit of info to paint a picture of what kind of student I am. I've had a summer internship every year since Year 1 of my degree, I've been active in 2-3 extracurricular clubs (1 very relevant to my field of study), and after this next academic year I'll be starting a 1 year placement with a major company in my field. So not a slacker by any means. I also worked full time for a few years before going to university, and worked part time during my pre-university course (1 year long).   \n   \n \n\nThe subject of part time employment came up last night and I mentioned I don't need to get one as I am financially stable currently and can last until I start my placement. Their arguments were that I have lived too long a life of leisure (their words), I need to work and save money, people in life don't get governments grants paid into their banks every year they have to work for it, I'm avoiding paid work (even though all the internships I've had and will be doing are entirely my choice to undertake).  I should show a good work ethic by getting a part time job and putting it on my CV will show I'm proactive. \n\n \n\n \n\nMy argument was that I'd rather take the extra time I have to not work and put it towards other activities and relaxing before I start my full career, I don't need the money, the trade-off between doing 1-2 shifts a week and not having the money leads me to choose not to work. There is no room on my CV for a part time job, employers in my field don't care how many pints I've poured or tables waited on the weekend, they care about my technical knowledge and experience relevant to the role (which I can show via my internships and extracurriculars). I know this is true because I have been for 2-3 interviews already, 1 of which I got offered my upcoming placement, and not once did they ask about my previous work history. It was all technical knowledge about my field, and my knowledge of the company. \n\n \n\n \n\nI think they are annoyed because I can get by without working on grants/loans, and they see themselves as honest hardworking people who are funding my \"leisure time\". Even though in a few months I will be starting a 1 year placement with a massive company who make a major impact on their industry. I do feel guilty however, as I have friends and a partner who have to work part time to support themselves, and I know how stressful that can be. Although, I don't think I should be made to feel guilty and like I'm not being a productive person because I'm not putting myself through menial labour 8-16 hours a week when I don't have to. AITA?

We're saving up using a separate fund so we don't touch our emergency funds.\n\nThat said, I do understand that we could use this money on our daughter to take her on a trip or something, but my partner and I have both envisioned ourselves having a traditional wedding and it's something we both want. Are we assholes for spending this money on ourselves instead of our daughter?",

Tl;dr at the bottom in case I end up waffling on.\n\nI (22M) am planning on proposing to my girlfriend (23F) by this time next year. \n\nSo backstory, my girlfriend (L for reference)is obsessed with weddings. She has an obsession with watching wedding tv shows (especially ones focussed on the dress) and loves pricing up hypothetical weddings. All of this I'm completely fine with as I know I want to marry this girl and I think the world of her and marriage at this stage would have been a natural thought process regardless.\n\nThe reason that is all relevant is because she basically has an entire wedding planned out for if/when she gets married. I myself have no preconceptions about what I want for the wedding as long as the food is nice and there's at least one or two good beers on tap so I've said to her if/when we get married, she can basically plan it all. (This is not me burdening her with an incredibly stressful job, she beamed ear to ear when this suggestion was made, if she does want my help and input I will happily help).\n\nAlso she is a shopaholic. She shops at every opportunity she gets and it is her favourite way of passing time. \n\nIn discussion about weddings etc she tells me she has said her dream would be to shop for her own engagement ring. I myself want it to be a surprise when I propose and pick out the perfect ring for her to show her how well I know her and for it to be a surprise.\n\nNow, she can be fussy when it comes to jewellery. She is always grateful when it is bought for her and wears it when the person who bought it for her is around, but you can tell when she actually likes something or not as long as you aren't the person who bought it for her. Noticeably, she won't wear it unless that person is around. Hence why she has always wanted a watch but has never bought one due to how picky she is.\n\nRecently, when shopping I have noticed if I go into a shop to look at watches for myself I have noticed that she will get bored and look at rings so I have started playing a game of 'guess my favourite watch' as she will return with 'guess my favourite ring'. Because of this I have a list on my phone of every ring she has pointed out as her favourite and because of this I feel I could find a perfect ring. \n\nBasically I want to surprise her when I propose to her and sweep her off her feet by doing what she deems impossible and give her the perfect ring to go alongside what will hopefully be a perfect day for her. So WIBTA for risking messing it all up by doing something she explicitly said is the opposite of what she wants?\n\n\nTl;dr: my girlfriend has always dreamed of shopping for her own engagement ring but i want to surprise her with a well thought out perfect ring.",

We were talking and she asked me if I was inviting my extended family to my wedding. I told her no, and she seemed a bit shocked. I then went on to tell her that since her family is close to me, they were definitely coming. She found it kind of funny, but honestly seemed pretty concerned.\n\nTo give some context: I would absolutely invite my mother, and my grandparents. I wouldn't invite any of my 16 (8 by blood, the other 8 married in) aunts and uncles, any of their children, and not my even my sibling. My sibling hasn't made an effort to keep in contact with me since they moved to the other side of the country. My aunts and uncles tend to be attention seekers, and rude.\n\nMost importantly though, they also don't help my grandparents, who are dealing with a lot right now since my grandmother has dementia, and my grandfather had to retire to take care of her. I love my grandparents and stop by all the time to see them, and it breaks my heart that the have about 50 grandkids and great grand kids (ages range from almost 40 to 3), and none of them stop by or even call. I kind of blame their parents since they don't either, but I try to be understanding. \n\nI only have one aunt who I would even consider inviting, but I don't want to since she has a personality disorder and attention seeks all of the time.\n\nIt just wouldn't make sense to me to invite them since they've never made an effort to be a part of my life. On the other hand, my friends family invites me to family gatherings, takes care of me when they have the chance, and legitimately put in the effort to ask me how my life is going. I would definitely invite her extended family, who practically treat me like their child.\n\nBut then again, I see lots of other people who invite their family who they aren't close with, and I feel like a jerk. Like, I should just put up with it because I should at least give them the opportunity to be involved in my life. If they found out my friend's family came, they would probably be really hurt, especially my aunt. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR; my family isn't close to me, but my friends family is.

He doesn't live with us, but my dad loves him there. I never really liked him around, to be honest. Sometimes he's funny and I know he's my brother, but he's had a myriad of drunken blow ups where he would physically attack anyone who dares make him even somewhat angry. I knew for a fact something was going to go down that day because he was already coming after me a few points like getting in my face and stuff. I told my dad to get him out of there, but he refused. Well later that night, they started fucking around and knocked over the T.V. in the living room. I came out saying \"What the fuck happened? The fuck is wrong with you guys?\" Then he got angry and started insulting me and my girlfriend (who wasn't even there. I'm not sure why he started going on her), and I came back with some reply that I forgot what it was. He didn't like that. His reply was to throw me through my door and almost stomp on my face. I'm no weakling, but I honestly felt too scared and shocked to fight back. He got off, but I ran out of the house to call the cops. They did nothing, and I just slept at my girlfriends house that night. I've never felt so weak in my life.

He says things like, your poor, your always riding someone’s dick, calls him an albino monkey, and is just a dick in general), he feels that it’s ok for him to dish out all of the shit, but whenever someone says something negative to him he immediately goes on the defensive and will throw back ruthless things at you, and he is just a dick in general. \n\nAlthough he can be a pretty fun guy to hang out with, I don’t want to paint him like a monster, because he is not.

(If you don't know, It's basically a trivia game, there's questions and if you know the answer, you buzz in).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, all my life, this game, i hate playing it because i always get so frustrated because if there's a question i know, and someone else knows it. I never can buzz in. It's always so frustrating. I hate losing at games like this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut, i typically perform well because i have a broad range of knowledge. I know a little bit about everything.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUntil Today. We played Jeopardy, and the categories were absolute crap. There was, like European history, Greek letters, and not one thing i knew shit about. But, in each round, there were categories she knew, 70s music and country music, because she grew up in the 70s and loves country. I don't.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, it was pretty much nothing but me getting beat, and the few questions i did know were common knowledge and she beat me on it. Then, there was one question, it asked about my all time favorite band and favorite song, i asked her to please let me have it. I begged her, but she didn't. She stole my answer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI only had, like, 400 points, she had around 3000. There were about 3 questions in a row i knew, but didn't buzz in since i couldn't risk the points loss. The second round was no better, the country music one came up. I asked if she could at least give me the answer to one, so i don't feel like such a dumbass. So i could at least have a chance. I've been far ahead when we've played, and let her get a question in out of fairness.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut she didn't. i was pretty much on auto-pilot then on. I just huffed and sighed at every question and just set the controller on the floor. I played on my phone during, i just didn't care. I was honestly pretty upset, i wanted to cry.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n I ended up with negative 5000. So, i threw the controller to the ground and left. She said she felt guilty for winning, and didn't let herself win. She bet all her points on the final and ended up with 0 so i didn't lose.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, am i the asshole here for acting like this?

		"story": "*I want to preface this post by saying that I've been on the fence about whether to post or not. I re-wrote it twice because I don't want it to come across like I'm looking for validation. I'm not. I'm feeling incredibly guilty right now and think I might be the a-hole.*\n\nLast weekend we had dinner at my inlaws' house. Much to my chagrin, my sister in law was there. To give some background on her, she's recovering from a meth addiction. Years ago she hit rock bottom and we ended up with custody of our nephew. There was a lot at play in him coming to live with us (mental instability, actual physical abuse, etc.), but the straw that broke the camel's back.\n\nWhen we got him, he was a timid, nervous and anxious little kid. He would flinch the instant anyone turned to talk to him or tried to hand him something. He was scared to tell us when he was hungry or thirsty and was constantly asking if he was behaving. It was heartbreaking. \n\nToday, he's a tremendous young man in his early 20's. He has his associates degree and is very independent. He shares an apartment with my oldest son, so my wife and I see a lot of him. We're both so proud of the adult that he's become and we try to make sure that we support his dreams. We truly see him as one of our kids, and we'd do anything to make sure he's living his best life.\n\nUnfortunately, his mother can crush his spirit in a heartbeat. All he wants is her approval, and she shames and rejects him constantly. Over the course of her many recovery attempts, she made a conversion to Christianity and her views became ultra conservative. She rants against abortion and the lgbtq community. My nephew happens to be gay, and she makes it clear that she doesn't approve. \n\nBack to the dinner. She went off on one of her tangents at the dinner table. Then she tried to turn her rage toward my nephew but I quickly shut her down. I didn't say anything, I just snapped my fingers and pointed at her with a pretty outraged expression. It was awkward but it diffused the situation.\n\nAfter dinner she went outside to smoke a cigarette, so I followed her outside and tried to talk to her about what happened. She made a snide remark about my wife and me taking everything she loved away from her (referring to the custody fight over my nephew) and I just erupted. I can be very direct when I have to be, and I felt like it was appropriate in this instance.\n\nI could feel the emotions swelling inside me and boiling over. Every bad memory from all those years ago came back to me. It felt like I was back in my hallway, listening from outside the bedroom door while my little nephew cried and begged God to fix his life. I know I said some very harsh things but they were all true. And honestly, it felt cathartic. I didn't yell at all. I just spoke in matter of fact tones, but I was harsh.\n\nAt first my SIL didn't say a word, she just stood there with tears rolling down her cheeks. My wife came outside just in time to catch the tail end of my rant. My SIL went inside and grabbed her purse, then came back outside and told us, \"I'm trying my best.\" Then she got in her car and drove away. We left shortly after her and spotted her pulled over on the side of the road, still in the neighborhood. She was sitting in her car with her head hung in shame. I felt a massive wave of guilt roll over me that I still can't shake. I wanted to stop and make sure she was okay but my wife told me to keep going.\n\nSince then I can't shake the feeling that I bullied someone who's struggling. When she wasn't addicted to drugs, she was a caring and empathetic human being who loved everyone, but especially her son. Her life has taken several erratic turns, and I'm truly rooting for her to get it together. But I felt so desperate to protect my nephew from her in that I couldn't think straight. My inlaws aren't upset with me at all and my nephew actually came over and thanked me for standing up to her. Still, I feel so guilty for my actions, and for how I made her feel.\n\nAITA for going off on my SIL who's recovering from a serious meth addiction?\n\nTL;DR: I went off on my sister in law this weekend. She struggles with mental illness and is a recovering drug addict. I'm feel like the worst person in the world right now. ",

I also want to go to law school once I graduate after taking a few years off to work, but she went directly into law school from undergrad. \n\nAs soon as she even started studying for the LSAT she would always rant to me about how hard it was. To make it worse, I go to a college across the country from where she currently lives, so most of our interactions are on Snapchat or phone calls. In the beginning, she would snapchat herself studying for the LSAT and preparing her applications to law school all the time. I supported her through it but once she actually got in to law school, it got worse.\n\nLiterally 90% of her Instagram posts are about law school. She’ll post to her story about eating cheese and caption it something like “cheese &gt; law school”. Her captions always have to mention law school to the point where it’s driving me nuts, because every time we actually do talk on the phone about my law school plans, she’ll say something condescending like: “are you sure you want to do it? It’s so hard. Please don’t do it.”\n\nNot only did I support her and continue to deal with her law school life 24/7, but I would expect her to at least reciprocate the same for me. I went to a top university for undergrad and she went to a state school (where she also happens to attend law school). Not like it matters, but saying “it’s so hard, don’t go to law school” feels like she’s telling me I can’t do it, even though I made it to an incredible university and have been working my ass off while studying so I can get those extracurriculars in. \n\nNow I’m literally triggered every time she posts about law school on Instagram or sends me a Snapchat of her “giving her first law school presentation” or “getting an A on her law paper!” I’ve supported her but now I’m just kind of tired and feel like I’m faking my excitement for her because she’s overdone it at this point. All she ever talks about is law school and I understand that it’s a huge achievement and big part of her life and she deserves bragging rights, but it’s gotten to the point where it’s just ridiculous.\n\nTLDR; my best friend got into law school and will not stop posting about it or telling me about it.

		"story": "This actually happened last year, but I want an outside opinion on the situation.\n\nFirst, a bit of background. Since I was young my tech illiterate parents always came to me for IT support for very basic things. This got even worse when I got a GCSE in IT, so I always had to fix problems, no matter how easy or basic. This included:\n\n• Pressing reset on the router\n\n• Plugging the ethernet cable back into the TV when it came out\n\n• Finding files on their computer\n\n• Deleting Facebook posts and other showing them how to work the site, despite not using it myself\n\n• Installing apps on their phones\n\n• Attaching files to emails\n\n• Setting up every new device in the house (printers, laptops, TVs, etc)\n\nI had to do all of this and more multiple times as my parents refused to learn how to do basic IT tasks themselves. Every time I had to reset the router or save a word document I would say something along the lines of \"You should really do this yourself\" to which they would reply with \"Why? We have you to do it\". \n\nLast year I decided to stop. My Mum came to me with something basic I'd had to do several times before and I told her to do it herself or get my brother to help (he pretends to be tech illiterate to get out of this sort of stuff). Then she  got upset and started saying how we were a family and should help each other, to which I said you shouldn't need help with this, you've been using this stuff for years. My Mum was off with me for a while and basically guilt tripped me into helping again and said something along the lines of \"we provide everything for you so you should help us with this\".\n\nAs of today I still have to help with phone and computer problems, although they have gotten slightly more independent, but still \"need\" my \"skills\". Next year I will be (hopefully) going to university several hours away and I know they'll still try to get me to fix their minor problems, making me wonder if I shouldn't have given in.\n\nI have no other issues with my family, but this really did and still does annoy me.",

		"story": "For ten years, \"A\" and I were pretty much best friends. We'd roomed together in college, hung out all the time, and talked just about every day.\n\nOver the years I began to notice that she had some not so great tendencies. She was diagnosed with adult ADHD and as such was forgetful, and often times a little... gross (she hates bathing and works a very messy job). I know I am not perfect, I, myself have OCD and struggle to keep it under control at times. We both left school at the same time, her to be closer to home, me to get my health and finances in order.\n\nThere's a history of her being super inconsiderate about my material stuff and not respecting my time. When she came to visit me at home, where I lived with my parents while I tried to save to go back to school and move out, she would probably break something once a visit. I worked a minimum wage job and had to pay rent, my food bill, and a portion of the utilities at home. She was paid just under twice what I was, didn't have to pay rent, and was given her car by her mom. When she would visit, she'd do things like jump into my bed and break my box spring, or throw herself into my desk chair and snap off the back of it, or ignore that I asked her to be careful with an electronic and toss it off my bed. I tried to bring these things up to her, but she would shrug it off and say \"they're just things.\" I lost a lot of my pay having to replace what she broke.\n\nThe time thing is worse though. I work three jobs, go to school full time, and have volunteer requirements for my scholarships. But every time we make plans, she's really late. I've been very patient about this, the only thing I ask is for her to let me know when plans change. I have days where I call off work an hour early, or plan a volunteering gig for half a day so I can hang with her. And not only does she get there two hours late, she doesn't let me know. The worst thing is that she then gets mad at other friends for missing the train and being late because she doesn't feel like waiting. She also complains that college is a \"waste of time\" and \"useless,\" despite the fact that after getting my shit together, I went back to school and became a model student and I really care about what I do. I try to explain but she forgets and says she can't help it because ADHD just makes her late.\n\nI must have explained a dozen times why these things bothered me so much, and she refused to listen. But if she got upset I did something and let me know even once, I made *sure* never to do it again. I'm not perfect, but if I caught myself, I apologized and righted the situation. I never had to be told twice.\n\nAnd in the last year or so, there have been two major incidents:\n\nThe first was her going house hunting and inviting me to join the roommate party. I was totally down for this as I live in a dorm rn. As a group we decided our needs. Mine was \"I can't afford more than $400 a month for rent.\" Along with transit, food and utilities, that was as much as I could do. We had a list of places we were looking for, and only one was out of budget--about $600 for each of us. That was the one she chose. She refused to go with our second option that met all our *needs* because she'd have to park at the bottom of a hill, which she didn't *want*. I was devastated--I'd already cancelled my housing contract and had to beg to be let back in. She wouldn't listen when I explained that I was upset. Six months later, my now girlfriend, N, suggested we move in together when we finish school. A got mad at me, and tried to sabotage my friendship with N. Now N makes me really happy. My ex was really jealous all the time, and so having a partner who's very sweet to me and comfortable with our relationship is *great*. But A specifically got jealous that N was \"taking her place\" since A and I were supposed to move in together. But she didn't respect my needs...\n\nThe second is what I can only call her... temper tantrum. Having ADHD, she's forgetful and would ask me to remind her of things. I have a decent memory so if she asks me once, I can remember for months or years. She has the memory of a fly. One of her things was that when she visited, she had to remember to keep her wallet out so she could put her ID away when she was leaving. She was feeling grouchy that day, but as she was packing up, I reminded her to keep her wallet out. She threw her bag on the ground, yelled \"I don't want to get my wallet out!\" and then, no joke, threw herself on the floor and wouldn't move for ten minutes, complaining that she had to do *so much stuff*. I'd asked nothing of her the entire visit. We had snacks, listened to music, and sketched. She'd spent the entire day complaining about her mom not being interested in the same stuff as her. And how it wasn't her fault her parents had money and that didn't mean she had a great life, and her parents pushed her to try activities she didn't like, like basketball camp. (I grew up in a trailer, eating food from food banks. She often complained about how no one understood that she didn't *ask* to be financially comfortable and that people shouldn't judge her on the fact her parents were wealthy enough to own two houses.) Worst of all, when she fell, she broke the closet door of my dorm and refused to help pay because it was an \"accident\". I had to wait for ten minutes while she sat there and complained about how awful life was and she wouldn't move. I was literally trapped in my room.\n\nAfter these incidents, I started to feel really uncomfortable around her. But she kept explaining that it was all because she has ADHD. She doesn't *remember* when I tell her things that upset or hurt me. She can't help that she doesn't get places on time or is heavy handed. She doesn't shower because she gets distracted (which I didn't go into. the OCD kills me because she doesn't wear deodorant because she forgets and she doesn't shower more than twice a week. she works with animals. she sits on literally freshly laundered bedding all the time). It was all because of ADHD. I hesitantly let it go on a few more months.\n\nThen, a couple months ago, we had scheduled a day to get together. Finals were about to hit, it was the year anniversary of my grandfather's death, and I was having a rough time. I explained that it was really important to me that we hang out - I needed to do something fun. She was gonna swing by after a family breakfast, which she scheduled *after* she scheduled our hangout, and we were gonna go to the mall. We were texting through the breakfast and I messaged to confirm the time twice, and then: \"**let me know if plans change**.\" I was volunteering that morning with friends and said goodbye and left early to get changed and ready to hang out. I waited for *two hours* for her to contact me. I texted her three or four times, called a handful of times, and she hadn't responded even once. She called me back at 3:30 and explained \"oh my mom made me late and I didn't let you know because I didn't want to feel bad about it.\"\n\nI stopped talking to her after that. Except for to try to explain why I was upset that she'd done it again--where she ignored everything I said and accused me of having her \"walking on eggshells\" because I would bring up finances when she broke my things or when the rent thing happened. I feel gross about it because we've been friends for a decade. But she just forgot whenever I tried to explain that the things she was doing hurt me.\n\n**Seriously TL;DR**: \"Friend\" of ten years refused to respect my boundaries or comfort zone, caused financial troubles, was never on time, blamed everything on ADHD, and then got mad at me for saying I was upset. \n\nAm I just being insensitive about her disorder, or am I right in feeling used and cutting her off?

She and I have never gotten along, like ever. So in the last few years she gone form fat to massively obese. She won’t be weighed but she could be 350lbs and I wouldn’t be surprised. She is also on this massive kick that she’s as hot as any other girl, she’s super healthy and she can do anything that everyone else can and she’s fat and proud.

		"story": "UPDATE:  I went to the party and had an amazing time!  Felt loved, met new people, ate good food, had a few drinks and genuinely had fun!\n///\n\nI came home for the holidays.  (I am mid-30’s, just divorced/sad, having a real hard time, no children.)  Usually my younger/single sister comes home too, but she is spending the holidays traveling.  My parents left today (Dec 30) to spend NYE on a cruise.  I didn’t want to spend the money (and didn’t have the deep desire) to join them or my sister.  (Separate topic!)  Being alone for a few days in warmer weather (here).. it’s kind of what I wanted.  I’ve had a real shitty year.\n\nSo here’s the thing.  Our neighbors, who are super close to my parents (not so much to me), and have been amazing and supportive through the years, are insisting and insisting that I come over to their house for New Year’s Eve.  I don’t want to go.  There are parties in clubs and in bars in our city, and maybe at the last minute I go to one of them on my own, but as of now I don’t want to go anywhere.  I want to spend the evening by myself, devoid of small talk and fake laughs, without having to get all dressed up for anyone.  I want to make myself a nice and healthy dinner, cry if I need to, go to bed early, and wake up early on Jan 1st, make a nice healthy breakfast, work out, ride my bike to the pier, you know, just do healthy lonely people stuff. \n\nI have been avoiding the neighbors during the time I’ve been here because I just don’t want to talk to anyone.  And I’m afraid that I’ll start crying any minute if they ask how I’m doing.  They already complained that why was I neglecting them.  Pretty much scolded me for not coming over to say hello the day I arrived.\n\nMy controlling mother will be curious to know what I did for NYE.  There are cameras all over their house.  She already warned how “crazy and wild” NYE parties get around here, how many people die in car accidents, how many women get roofied, and how it would be “so nice” if I just spent it with the neighbors.  I am a grown woman but now that I am divorced, seems that I am a child again.  (Separate topic!)\n\nToday, I kind of implied to everyone while the neighbors were over, that maybe I couldn’t make it to their party, and they looked at me hurt and weird and asked what I was doing instead.  I lied and said I was going to one of the restaurant parties.  Bullshit and it was obvious.  Am I an asshole now?  \n\nAm I an asshole for declining the neighbor’s invite?  When I stay home they will see my lights on, know I’m home, and wonder why I didn’t join them.  How do I explain that I just want to be alone?

But over the summer, he started getting really flirty with me after he told me he broke up with his ex. It sounded like it had been a couple of months so I reciprocated and in no time we were sexting. But about a couple weeks later, he texts me saying how devastated he was because his ex had come to visit &amp; stay with him in his city and it turns out that she slept with another guy immediately after they broke up. \n\nAfter that he we stopped talking for 2 weeks and then he started flirting with me again. I asked him if I was a rebound or if he just wanted to fool around and he told me that it was neither for him, he was always attracted to me and now he has a crush on me. We then left it at that but kept sexting each other and having these intense conversations. \n\nBut a month later, he started to get really distant so I called him out on it and he told me that he was just dealing with the consequences of the summer. I felt sad because I realised that he probably wasn't over his ex and I was just a rebound so I asked for space. He said that I definitely wasn't a rebound but he gave me space anyway.\n\nDuring our time away from each other, I realised that he wasn't that great a friend and he wasn't being fair to me. He was always super flakey and I remember when I once told him my mum was sick he took 3 weeks to reply. And it felt like he just wanted me to stick around and fill in these voids for him.\n\nA month later we spoke again and he said he wanted to \"go back to what we were\". I said that I wasn't sure I wanted to do that because I was still hurt from everything. At this point he'd reply at his own convenience so I got really anxious and I felt like I didn't matter to him at all and blocked him. He then texted me on Instagram and we had a long conversation - I said that it was too late to talk it out now and then blocked him there as well.\n\nTwo months after that, he came back to my city and asked if I wanted to meet him - I said no way not at all and asked him to respect my decisions. He told me that he understood but he showed up at my university anyway. And so I hid. \n\nHe eventually left and I went home.\n\nBut I'm curious, AITA?",

I always had suspicions that she wasn’t over her ex.  Not just suspicions but proof from her words and the fact that she got excited when he asked her to hang out (and would hang out with him alone from time to time). \n\n Over the summer I took a study abroad course for 6 weeks.  In that time she broke up with me and hooked up with her ex.  Long story short, we patched up some obvious problems and got back together.  Although I was having second thoughts about the whole thing I acted like I was fine in order to not relive the situation.\n\nGF (along with a little encouragement from me) decides to moved into an apartment a few blocks away from me.  About one week goes by and I could tell she was acting strange about her ex.\n\nWhat I did next I am not proud of, but felt it was necessary so I could put my worries to rest for good.  One morning when she was in the shower I opened her computer and read the text conversion she had with her ex.  What I found was a conversation that spanned from the time we started dating up until about 4 months into the relationship (well before I went abroad).  The conversation included her saying things like “I miss you” “you will always be my best friend” and “I miss having sex with you”.\n\nMind you, these texts were from about 8 months ago.  However, I could not find it in myself to forgive her and I felt as though I will never trust her again.  After all she was texting these things to her ex while telling me that she loved me and that I was the only one for her. I broke it off cold turkey about 2 weeks ago and haven’t seen or talked to her since. She is furious that I persuaded her to move near me and broke up over something that happened a while ago.  The way I see it, our relationship is ruined and she needed to get out of the house anyway, therefore I don’t really feel guilty for it. Am I the Asshole? Honestly asking.",

		"story": "I'm 21 years old, out of the house, and looking at getting into my next job. I've distanced myself from my family on account of it being a huge toxic mess where absolutely everyone in it, from my 14 year old brother (one of the persons in question) down to my dad, is incredibly terrible to some degree, with the most of it coming from my narcissistic, lazy dad who refuses to discipline the kids. I also have not been around due to military service for 3 years, so realistically I couldnt have been around much anyways. This has resulted, officially, in them (a 15 yo sophomore girl and a 14 yo freshman) essentially flunking their current grades on account of how little they go to school (which was somewhat an issue when I was going to high school as well, though that was moreso due to lack of transportation than lack of initiative) and, unofficially, my middle brother (was 17 and in continuation school) dying in October from a drug overdose.\n\nSo, the issue: the kids dont want to go to school. They go to bed at unreasonable hours, they go back to bed when they are woken up, and one of them will actively insult and scream at you whenever you attempt to stir her up from bed past waking her up. It is abundantly clear to me they dont care, and the way I see it, I can show them they can always use me as a resource to get them to school, but I'm not in a mood where I'm going to basically drag them to water and make them drink. I can see the flip side of the arguement being that they're family and I should be looking out for them being their older brother, but I dont think I can do much when they dont even listen to or respect my mom or dad, and my dad gives them active reason not to care: when my mom disciplines them and takes stuff away (namely their phones or game consoles), my dad will go behind her back and give them right back...or let them go on the weekend when they were told they cant do anything, or let them have friends over when they were told they cant, it's a huge parental issue in my opinion. \n\nI'm of the opinion that, frankly, the kids are fucked due to their lack of care and the lack of my dad being a solid husband and father. I dont want to be screamed at when trying to help the kids out and I dont want my life to have to revolve around trying to make them care about something that not even my dad cares about, so my question is this: AITA for being laissez faire with the kids on their lack of care for getting to school?",

I just want to know if the feelings I have are justified...hence: am I the asshole. \n\nSix years ago I was 22 and started dating the absolutely most perfect guy on the planet. Saw sparks immediately, fell hard for him within the first few dates, he says he fell just as hard. We had an amazing first year courtship. I mean literally out of a fairytale romance novel. I was so in love with him I could not see strait. \n\nSo exactly one year in, his high school sweetheart shows up on the scene with a baby she claims is his. The timing of it was right from the last time he's seen her (kid was about 2 years old) and she claimed that she didn't know who the baby's father was at first but now was certain it was him and she needed him in his life. This part of the story could go on for pages but fast forward to the baby wasn't his, DNA test proved it. It was some sort of crazy girl shakedown because the real father wouldn't buy her a car or some such craziness that people get themselves into. \n\nI was so relieved and figured our relationship would continue unabated after this minor bump in the road. However the baby scare freaked him the fuck out. He claimed he was still in love with me but he'd seen into the face of fatherhood and commitment and he just wasn't ready and broke up with me. I was devastated beyond words. Like couldn't eat sleep, eat or even breathe. He went off on a summer vacation sold travel around Europe by himself. About two weeks in, I decided I couldn't be without him so I texted him that I needed to talk. He didn't respond right away so maybe two days later I texted him back that I was super late, was probably pregnant and I wasn't asking for him to come back, I just wanted him to be aware. I 100% was not pregnant.  \n\nHe called me immediately and asked what my plans were. I told him that I planned on getting an abortion but I felt like he should no. He told me to not do anything rash and that he would change his ticket and come home as soon as he was able. So when he got home he told me that he loved me, that he wanted to be with me, that his ex-GF scare wasn't my fault and he was sorry he bolted and that he wanted to keep the baby. I really hadn't planned for that happening that quickly. \n\nSo perhaps fortunately I got my period maybe two weeks later and was able to convince him that he blood was probably a miscarriage. I told him I was too scared to disappoint him and pretended to drive myself to planned parenthood where I concocted a fake miscarriage story. He never asked for any proof but he was deeply upset that the \"baby\" didn't make it. \nI pretended to be upset by the \"miscarriage\" too.\n\nWe pretty quickly both realized that it was probably for the best and our relationship more or less picked up where it had left off before. We aren't not perfect by any stretch of the imagination but I truly love him. He supports me in my career, he's amazing, he's wonderful and I can't live without him. We got married about 3.5 years ago.\n\n\nSo in December we had our first baby, an amazingly beautiful little boy who we both adore. My husband is amazing father and is willing to sacrifice just about any material good so I can be a SAHM. Everything we have is amazing. He's in the Navy, we live in an amazing little beach side community in California, he's a wonderful dad. I could not ask for more. \n\nBut I know in my heart all of it is based on a lie.

He absolutely loves to assert himself as being smart, and tends to get very competitive about.\n\nOne of the ways this manifests is with backseat driving.  I don't drive him often (we're both adults and neither of us live at home/with each other), but when I do, it crops up, especially if he's in a bad mood for whatever reason.  These are not comments that are necessary reminders, they're usually pissy little asides like \"You didn't have to let that car go ahead of us, you know\" or \"You don't have to change lanes yet, but whatever\".  Dumb shit like that.  I've asked him to stop before and he's always said \"I'm not being snarky, I'm *helping* you.\"\n\nNeedless to say, I hate this, and I honestly find it distracting as hell.

He kept insisting this was for our own safety, though he didn't at any point offer to drive in the downpour.\n\nThere is a family event coming up that is going to be 1) about a ninety-minute drive, and 2) really early in the morning, so he will probably be cranky.  We might all be able to go together (in which case, our dad would drive us over), but if we can't, I may have to drive him.

Every time you make another comment, I will pull over again.\"\n\nI realize this makes it sound like I'm chastising a child, but at the same time, I legitimately don't know what else to do (other than just not driving him, period, which would cause a rift with my dad/the rest of the family).

For the first year or so, all was normal and our relationship was totally great, and then she went on a hormonal birth control pill. Her sex drive plummeted, and around sixth months ago we had a talk where she confided that she was really uncomfortable doing sexual things any more, and that she was only doing them at all because she felt like she had to for my sake. I apologized, since I obviously didn't want her to feel that way, and we've been pretty much celibate since then (I told her we should only be doing sexual things if she was interested in doing them). She started seeing a counselor for that two months ago, and I'm hopeful that in time things will return to normal there.\n\nIn addition to the above, I have felt like our relationship has been lacking in emotional intimacy for the last while. Two nights ago, I decided to try to bring up how I was feeling to her, and told her that at times it has felt more like she has been my roommate than my girlfriend, and that I'd really appreciate if we could try to spend more time together. She was receptive and the talk felt pretty productive, we set a date for the two of us this Thursday. \n\nAfterwards, though, she told me that a friend of hers asked her on Monday if she would be interested in the two of them being \"queer platonic partners\", and she asked me for my permission to say yes. I asked her what that meant, since I had never heard of the term before, and she described it as \"a platonic relationship with a lot more of an emotional commitment\". I told her honestly that from how it sounded I wasn't comfortable with it.\n\nShe told me that she might be explaining it badly, and that she'd appreciate if I could google the term and read up about it and then talk to her again about it. I did, and google described it pretty much the same way that she described it. We talked last night, and I tried to explain that I didn't mind if she had close, emotionally involved friendships, since that's none of my business, but that choosing to label it with a \"relationship\" word felt like it was crossing a line for me (especially since my girlfriend is bisexual). I also said that I was feeling kind of insecure in our relationship at the moment, especially because of the intimacy issues I raised the other night, and hearing from her right after I talked to her about that that she wanted to enter into a deep emotional commitment with someone who wasn't me felt kind of disheartening. The conversation ended with her agreeing not to say yes to her friend.\n\nAm I being the asshole here?

We met during a summer camp where he was a volunteer and fell in love immediately. After spending 2 weeks together at the camp we went long distance. We've met 3 times since, twice when he came to visit me and once when I went to him. My parents don't know about him and for reasons I'd rather not talk about, I can't tell them. \n\nNow here's my big deal. I want to go to the same university as him (because I wanted to go there from the start and not because he is there). There is an math exam required in order to get a place, and said exam is VERY hard. Now, my math is quite decent, atm I can say that I'd score an 8/10 at that exam. The problem is that I really want to get as high a grade as possible because my parents will never accept to pay for my college, so I need to get in for free (quite limited number of places).\n\nLast week the university started organising some training courses where they show their future students how to approach solving the questions of the exam. So I convinced my parents to let me go to his city and attend those courses every week (a lot of money involved). I went to the courses and afterwards I spent the day with my bf. It was amazing.\n\nThe problem is this. He wants to spend more time with me, and wants a little privacy (which I totally understand), but in order to go to his home (1h train ride away from the University city) we would need to leave the courses early to catch the train. He says he's been to these courses last year and has it all written in a notebook that he can let me have, so I don't miss out. I don't agree with skipping those courses just to spend time with him, simply because 1) they're very important to me, I feel like it helps me understand math a lot better and 2) my parents have spent a lot of money for my education so I can get to that university, last thing I want is to fail myself, or them.\n\nWe talked about this last night, he says he feels like I don't love him and that the sacrifices he made for me were kind of pointless because I'll never do the same for him. We're both committed to this relationship as much as possible, and I don't consider breaking up anytime soon. I love him, but I feel like this is going too far. He says he knows he doesn't want any other girl in his life, but I'm neither ready nor willing to make that statement anytime soon. \n\nSo, reddit.

In the middle of these 5 years, we started an online business together.\n\nThe business was my idea, and I was fully prepared to go through it on my own. However, my husband, upon seeing me struggle with some aspects of the business, decided to help me, as he had a lot more knowledge than me in the area. Of course, I was happy to get the help! But he kept repeating stuff like \"You'll never be able to do this without me\" \"I sacrificed years of my life for YOU\"  \n\n\nHis parents had abused him emotionally growing up. I took him into my house (before we were married, we were fairly young), tried my best to give him what he needed. However, taking care of someone who's been through that took a toll on me, and I ended up snapping on him multiple times. I'm not proud of those moments.\n\nThe abuse caused him to become extremely impatient. He would lose his shit every time I did a small mistake, go completely bonkers whenever I would cry due to his outbursts. I began to be afraid of little things. I was scared of giving my opinion (and thus, would default to agreeing with him). I was so scared that it affected all of the spheres in my life.This only caused my productivity to drop like mad.

However, I would hold it in, all of my feelings, and I'd rather talk it out in private, just between me and him. This led to our entire circle getting his side of the story everytime, further isolating me socially. I couldn't help but shake the feeling that he was doing so with our business partners as well. I asked him about it, and he lied to me and told me he never revealed anything personal to any of our partner. So, I logged into his emails and read the back and forth between him and the BPs.  \n\n\nAnd here it was. Laid down were detailed facts about our fights, relationships and just generally my flaws as a person. Basically, he ruined my chances of ever starting anew with any of them, as they now have access to parts of my life I never gave him the consent to expose.\n\nI confronted him about this and told him that I went through his email. He immediately went for the divorce and is considering kicking me out of the company(Which is now easy to do, since pretty much everyone hates me - AND he told them I went through his emails)  \n\n\nI feel horrible for breaching everyone's privacy.

Another thing, I have worked in the service industry for some time and I understand service jobs are difficult and people are assholes. I am not the type to talk to a manager or complain, I like to think I’m pretty understanding. So I had a plane booked from Portland to Vegas, and then Vegas to Austin. I missed the check in by maybe 10 minutes (freeway incident, but still my fault I’ll accept), and the gate attendant refused to help, saying there was nothing she could do and that it was my fault for not checking in online (which I couldn’t, since I was traveling with my dog). She walked away from me as I was trying to explain my situation and put up a sign that check in was closed for my flight. Thankfully I was able to catch another flight to Vegas so I wouldn’t miss my flight to Austin. Just my luck, it’s snowing in Vegas for the first time in a decade, so a bunch of flights get canceled or delayed. Mine gets delayed from midnight to 2 pm. I don’t know anyone in Vegas, and it being late at night, and having a dog, finding a hotel for one night last minute seemed like an expense I couldn’t justify. So I wait at the airport, until finally! 2pm! No plane at the gate, no attendant. there was no one to ask. After ~30 min of waiting I strike up a conversation with some other  passengers, and we exchange grievances and just generally bitch about spirit. Not far from us are the flight attendants, who don’t know anything. We eventually notice that they’re cracking jokes about the plane not being here and how unreliable the estimated times are, in front of us. Maybe I’m being sensitive, but to say that in front of dozens of people who have had to spend the night on an airport floor is pretty insulting. So at this point, I get annoyed and it was immature but I start being a bit bolder with my complaints. After talking about my experience with the gate attendant, and all of us complaining about how late the plane is and the lack of information, finally the plane pulls up. 15 hours after the scheduled time. one of the flight attendants comes up to me, asks me what my seat is, and says he’ll “take care of me” and that he’s “so very sorry” (verbatim) about my experience. Again, maybe me being sensitive, his tone seemed a little sarcastic? This is why I’m writing this. I immediately felt a LOT of guilt and embarrassment and I ended up apologizing to HIM for my incessant bitching. I don’t feel like I’m in the wrong for being upset that I spent a lot of money to catch a flight that I had to wait 15 hours for but AITA for complaining loud enough for an attendant to feel like he should apologize to me? Either way, I think it was pretty rude of the attendants to speak amongst each other that way in front of all the passengers.

Before you all jump down my throat for dating someone so young, she’s wise beyond her years. It took me a while to admit to myself I had feelings for her because I didn’t want her to see me as some creepy old man, but she is truly amazing. \n\nNow on to my problem. She is definitely the most insecure person i’ve ever met and I truly don’t understand why. She’s 5”5 and around 130lbs. She’s in great shape and goes to the gym practically everyday. Due to stress and medication she hasn’t really been eating so i’ve been trying to get her to do so because she was originally around 165lbs about four months ago(it’s funny though because she didn’t look overweight by any means and now she looks very thin). I am not trying to fetishize her but she has this gorgeous exotic look to her and her skin is this beautiful caramel color. Despite all this, she’s convinced she is (to quote her own words) “a fat waste of space”. She had trouble with eating disorders  when she was younger but went to rehab for it and really struggled with bullying because she used to be obese when she was little. \n\nNow to give you an idea of how much this is hurting our relationship, here is the list of things I am not allowed to do. Take her shirt off during sex even if the lights are off, eat her out because “you probably hate it but you’re just lying to protect my feelings” (i’m not), touch her stomach in anyway, compliment her because (you’re just lying), or literally see her upper body in anyway. From time to time if she’s drunk or stoned enough she’ll randomly send me a nude or show up at my place and rip everything off and I really don’t understand her hang up because her body is amazing. Like really. Toned stomach and what i would estimate is at least a DD cup (which she hates because she thinks they’re saggy... THEYRE NOT)\n\nAll of this reached a point where I said enough is enough and told her to get help. She went on antidepressants (which have visibly been helping with her overall mood) and started therapy. It’s been months and NOTHING changed. She still turned away if I walked in on her changing, no shower sex, shirt stays on... you get it. So I sat her down and asked her once and for all if she could please make an effort because god.. I want to TOUCH her. I want her skin on mine. Not being able to just hold her is the most sexually frustrating thing i’ve ever experienced and I feel like a teenage boy again. She just started crying (which freaks me out because she literally never cries in front of me) saying that she was trying her best and that ‘pressuring her’ is just making it worse.\n\nNow I really didn’t think I was pressuring her.

I started getting really shaky before she was about to tattoo another huge part of my arm (elbow ditch, eek). Like not just kinda shaky, but REALLY REALLY shaky like I couldn’t stop my whole body from shaking hard. I assumed it was blood sugar and I said as much, then finished the rest of my juice.

I didn't really know how to react because A) I think promise rings are stupid, and B) I'm not the type of guy that wears any jewelry. I thanked her and put on the ring for a bit to make her happy until she left. The next day (today) she asked me why I wasn't wearing it. I tried avoiding telling her the truth and just said \"Because I don't want to\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe got upset by that answer and started accusing me that I wasn't really committed to our relationship or that I'm embarrassed to be seen with her, which is not true at all. I told her the truth and said that it's because promise rings are a stupid idea and kinda childish. It's literally a promise before promising a promise. Her logic is \"why wont you wear a ring now if you're eventually gonna wear one when we're married?\" To me there's a huge difference between a wedding band and a promise ring, but she doesn't see it that way and is upset with me.

He’s super masculine, a carpenter, hunter, a little too afraid of gay men for no good reason, you know the type. All in all, I think he has a good heart and treats my friend well.\n\nBut. \n\nMy friend is an extremely kind caring person, the type who you wouldn’t find questioning whether or not she’s an asshole, because she just isn’t. And I think Evan might take advantage of it. He says things like, “I can’t do any of the cleaning, she says I do it wrong so I don’t even bother helping” or, “I can only cook ramen, and I don’t feel like learning, but she’s so good at it, I don’t even worry” or, my personal favorite, “Yeah I plan on puttin a baby in her soon. I haven’t decided exactly when would be right.” And my friend just laughs these things off.\n\nSo recently I tried to make plans to go to dinner with her, Evan, and my boyfriend. As I broached the topic of these plans she said, “Oh no. No way. Evan is watching the football game tonight. There is only a month left in the season, I can’t wait until it’s over so I can stop planning everything around when Evan watches the games.” To which I said, “Yikes.” And she got so mad at me, we ended up getting in a pretty serious argument where she kept telling me how Evan does everything for her, and she would never stop him from game watching for dinner, and it’s not about compromise she just wouldn’t tell him what to do. Now my friend is happy, she loves this man, all in all he seems like a good person, but I can’t help feel like his quasi-misogynistic words go a little too far. I can’t decide if I’m an asshole for trying to help someone who (in my independent lady mind) is doting upon a man who doesn’t give too much back. Or if I’m right and she’s suppressed. ",

And I just told her I don't really want to do this I am really tired right now and need to catch up on my sleep. She was furious, and called me a lazy piece of shit.

I said to him when he asked for that amount that it’s too much, it’s usually between £4-6 and then he got angry and said it’s the meter but when I corrected him and told him his meter was not running he got angrier and switched it on very aggressively while kinda shoving my leg in the process. When he switched the meter on from stand by mode it said the fair should’ve only cost £4.60. I called him out on why he’s asking an absurd amount so he told me to just get out of the car while cursing at me. I sank to his level and cussed and argued back because I’m thinking of how many of my regular customers this man has ripped off previously without it being called out.

My first thought was to swipe up and say “woah cool car” or something of the like. However what soon came to my mind was the fact that my two of my good friends lost their cars in the fire, along with many residents of the town. So I sent her a message about it.\n\nI worded it very deliberately to not outwardly attack her for posting this, suggesting that she maybe should post about it later because a lot of people lost their possessions, they probably wouldn’t like to see someone showing off their brand new car. \n\nShe immediately jumped on me, extremely offended at what I said, telling me off, she brought up that I wasn’t directly affected by the fire, therefore I shouldn’t speak for those who were, which I could understand. However she began to tell me that I was saying shes not allowed to be happy and despite me telling her otherwise she insisted thats what I was saying. \n\nI tried to explain to her that I wasn’t trying to tell her what to do, that I just trying to lend perspective that it might be seen as insensitive, but she just warded me off with a “thanks.”\n\nAm I the asshole?",

A few times she told me she wanted to stop things here using excuses like \"you are too perfect for me\" \"I don't deserve you\" etc, wich I replied it was bullshit excuses and If she wanted to stop here she would need to be honest, and to wait until we meet to take any decision. Every time she would agree and the next day the sweet texts would continue on her initiative. But as the time pass I got a bad feelings about my trip, and I was pretty much convinced I wouldn't see her. Yesterday her brother call me and tell me his other brother won't be able to shelter her for the week I was staying here and we need a solution wich I found. But in her head, the decision was taken cause she have too much distance to travel and she won't be able to quit her boyfriend.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere I stop to be neutral and describe my feelings. It has been like 2 weeks I feel like I'm being used, she needed some attention that she didn't have at home and found it with me. I told her a few times how insecure I am about intimates relationships and she never stopped her bullshit. I felt she violated my trust only to feel loved. In 3 words I felt fooled. So I grabbed my phone and called her boyfriend to tell him she was fooling both of us, that I could provide screenshots or further explanation if he want. Honestly I did it for two reasons : I was hurt and felt the need to hurt her, and he deserve to know she's not trustworthy and willing to emotionally cheat on  him.",

I have a boy under 2 &amp; hes got a girl who is just shy of starting school.\n\nWhen my neice was born, my mother pulled out the baby clothes from when my brother &amp; i were babies, having saved them specifically for her grandbabies to have. (She bought them for my brother and when i came along, i wore them too.) Sister-in-law wanted nothing to do with them for neice. Most are pretty gender neutral, so when my mom was babysitting and neice needed clothes changed, she would put on some of said clothes (a pair of jeans for example) so she could enjoy the outfit for a while, but SIL would come to pick her up and change her out of clothes before heading home, leaving childhood clothes at my moms house. We never asked wtf but theorized that maybe its because they were too masculine looking.\n\nFast forward a few years and i have my son. My mom gingerly asked if i would like the clothes, expecting more heartbreak over it but i was thrilled &amp; said hell yes. My little guy rocks the clothes pretty frequently &amp; grandma always has a huge grin to see him in them.\n\nNow, i found out my brother &amp; SIL are expecting a boy. So I'm stuck with the dilemma of what to do about the baby clothes. I feel im obligated to offer them to her as they WERE me brothers first, but she has a history of refusing to put baby in them. I worry about it because she is definitely a \"gift horse in the mouth\" sort of person and has told us often of recieving a gift that wasnt the \"right brand\" so she sold it and put cash towards the \"right\" one.\n\nMy concern is if i give her the clothes, whether on not they are worn by future nephew, that she will toss or sell them in the end. If she doesnt want them or they didnt have any more kids, i intended to put them away for my grandbabies to inherit.\n\nWIBTA to not offer her the clothes?

		"story": "To give this situation some necessary context, here are some details of varying importance.\n\nMy wife is a pharmacist and I work in education. She brings home about $50,000/year and I bring home about $75,000. We're both in our early 30s and have been together for almost ten years now. We're in a comfortable situation financially.\n\nAlright, let's begin with what my wife and I have found to be the bitter truth: she just does not like being a pharmacist. She absolutely hates it. Day after day she'll come home with a new complaint about something a patient or colleague did. One time a patient crumpled up a receipt and told her to throw it away. One time a patient pissed all over the toilet seat. One time a patient licked his fingers before counting money and handed the bills to her.\n\nSo a few months ago, we decided that maybe just dealing with customers kind of sucked. I'd been there and could relate. I asked if she would try working in a hospital (no direct contact with patients), and she agreed to try it out. She has worked there a month now, and the only thing that has changed is the nature of her complaints. She doesn't like her boss and she doesn't like her immediate supervisor. She doesn't like how busy it is there. She actually probably hates it more than her old job because at least in her old pharmacy, she could take a break every so often.\n\nA lot of her complaints are valid. Some of them seem a bit ridiculous--things that have happened to me and didn't even blip on my radar. I think most of it stems from the fact that, again, she really just doesn't like being a pharmacist.\n\nSo at this point we have basically tried all career avenues of pharmacy, and nothing is quite doing it for her. She wants to get into something else. I've repeatedly told her that I would be supportive of her career change if she thought it would make her happier, and she frequently seeks permission from me.\n\nLast Sunday, she suddenly came to me and said she wanted to be an esthetician at a women's spa. This wasn't exactly the most surprising thing in the world, as I know my wife loves beauty products/skincare related fields, but ... an esthetician? I mean absolutely no disrespect to estheticians as I know it's a job that requires a hell of a lot more than what I do at mine, but I can already hear her complaints about future customers. \n\nOf course this is a huge step for my wife. She is horrible at making decisions. I don't want to squash her dreams, as she seems really enthusiastic about this, but I have a really strong feeling that she's making a classic mistake. It's like loving Disneyland so much that you decide to work there, and all of a sudden you're stacking boxes in the back of the gift shop. I feel like her reasons for going into this career are all wrong and that we're going to be back in the same spot in a year, just with a whole lot of new problems and another job thrown into the \"not for me\" pile. And in the time, she will be taking a fairly massive salary hit. I agreed to support us, and I know I can, but the job offer she has is not offering her all that much at all.\n\nI'm honestly inclined to just start bringing up doubts about it, but knowing her personality, she would probably just give up on it. She actually seems excited to work there though and while I don't want to make her feel bad, but I really want to get this off my chest. I'm going against what I promised her, but I have serious doubts about this career choice for her. I'm frankly against the idea and want to tell her but feel like IWBTA. \n\n",

We have a Facebook group we use for coordinating various camping trips throughout the year, and a FB event was created in January for this trip in particular. Everyone is really excited and has been planning and preparing for months. One of us is flying in from out of state just to go on this trip. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have a friend in this group, let's call him Carl, who has not been that involved. Carl went on the previous winter trip a few years ago and was very enthusiastic about the idea of another one when it was brought up during our last camping trip in September. However, Carl has not been very involved in any of the planning or discussion. He's liked a couple posts here and there, but until this week, that was it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBecause it's winter and we're heading towards the mountains for this trip, the number of cars we have between us that are able to handle snowy conditions is limited to 2 - a friend's SUV, and an AWD sedan my partner and I are borrowing from his parents. Last week, we coordinated rides in the FB group - the SUV is full, and our sedan *might* have one seat open. Carl did not respond to this post in any way, either on FB or otherwise. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI want to note that Carl does not drive, and lives the furthest away. (The rest of live within a few miles of each other.) I had begun to assume he would no longer be joining us on the trip, since we leave first thing Saturday morning. On Tuesday, he posted in the FB group asking if there was an open seat for him somewhere and if we had reviewed weather forecasts and driving routes. We'd already discussed both of those things last week. My partner commented that we might have an available seat, depending on how much room is left after we load all of our gear and our dog. Carl did not respond until late last night, saying that he'll chip in for gas and doesn't mind riding with our dog.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm pretty frustrated that Carl has waited until the week of the trip to figure out a way to get there, and I'm not happy that we will have to be the ones to accommodate him. (My partner doesn't really mind one way or another. He's very non-confrontational.) Carl says he's been busy moving and dealing with an injury, which is why he hasn't been very responsive or involved, but this trip has been a long time in the making and he just started moving last week. In my opinion, if he's busy moving and has an injury, a severe-weather camping trip probably isn't the best idea. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for not wanting to bring him on this trip? I have no issue with him going in and of itself, but I'm not happy with having to accommodate him at the last minute like this.",

Long story short I pursued it and we’ve been dating six months. Then recently I’ve been going through a rough point with my other friends and just stuff in my life has been getting me down. I tend to be very internal, and always pretty positive, so my real feelings don’t always show. But She told me that I hadn’t been myself over text lately and that she felt neglected, that she had “been upset with me”. I explained that it wasn’t intentional and I completely opened up about all that I’m struggling with, but her response killed me. She essentially blew it off, saying: “I hope all that works out, but don’t forget about me” and “sorry I’m another thing to juggle but if you can’t juggle me I can’t be with you”\n\nNearly instantly all my feelings for her went away, and I felt like I could be anyone and she wouldn’t know the difference. I’m just a guy who juggles her and she is willing to move on if I start to struggle. After six months this was a major kick in the teeth but when I thought about it, it aligned with a lot of her other actions too. There’s a lot to that but the root of it is that I take a lot of hits to my pride and to my own happiness in order to make her happier, but when I really thought about it, I couldn’t think of a time when she’s done the same for me. I think she enjoys what comes with having a partner, but isn’t willing to make any sacrifices for my sake. \n\nIt’s important to understand that I am not a complainer. I would never expect or ask for someone to confess all my problems to, but I feel like I also shouldn’t be scolded for having a down point in my life. But after all that she says I’m her boy and she loves me. That’s where my problem comes in.\n\nI’m sorry for rambling but I think context is pretty important. I know spilling to strangers on Reddit probably isn’t the best move, but I just want a completely unbiased second opinion or two. I’m also aware that since this is all coming from me it’s probably biased, but I’ve done my best to present the truth.\n\nSummary: My girlfriend’s expectations of me are too high and I can’t see us going on for very long term because I just can’t be everything she wants. I’ve tried sticking it out for a while, but I want to break up with her. \n\nAm I the asshole for possibly breaking her heart out of self interest?\n",

		"story": "&amp;#x200B;\n\n**SHORT VERSION**: Guy likes me. I am not interested in him. Give him the cold shoulder instead of talking things through. AITA?\n\n**The whole story, below**:\n\nThis summer I was traveling in pursuit of my hobby, let's say underwater basketweaving. I went on a trip to a country where a lot of this happens and joined a group tour with about 40 other people. One of those people was \"Allen\", a man about 20 years older than me (I am female, mid-forties, single).\n\nEveryone in the group is friendly and we all get along since we share a common interest and are traveling together, sharing meals, activities, etc. One night getting off the bus, I am weirdly dizzy and off balance (thanks, jet lag) and worried about being able to walk to the hotel safely, so I explain my situation to Allen and ask him for support. He takes my arm and \"escorts\" me back to the hotel, and I am grateful and thank him. He asks me if I want to go out for a drink and I say no (that should have been a red flag for me - why was he inviting me for a drink when I was already so messed up, I could barely walk in a straight line?!). Anyway, the next day we sit on the bus together, and at first we're sort of becoming travel buddies and that seems cool. But then after a day or two of this I realize he's thinking more than friends, and I'm not interested in him that way. In fact I'm not even interested in being \"just friends\" because I just don't like him at all.\n\nWell, he's super interested in me and always right there, sitting next to me at meals, following me around when we're at museums, etc. He is really pushy, not reading any signals, and I am not happy. So I'm laying awake in my little hotel room trying to figure out how to deal with him in a direct but polite way. How to use my big girl words. And then I'm like fuck it, I am on vacation, I am not wasting my mental energy on figuring out how to be nice about \"breaking up\" with this guy. So instead of talking things through, I just give him the cold shoulder starting the next morning. I no longer talk to him, avoid him, and make sure I'm always seated with other people around me, so there's no spot for him near me.\n\nHe seems to get the point and goes so far to apologize to me for pushing too much and he realizes I'm not into him. It seemed really sincere and insightful. After that I'm willing to be polite and talk to him again, but he apparently misreads that and thinks I'm into him. So I go back to ignoring/avoiding him. The trip ends; everyone goes home.\n\nAt home he starts emailing me, and maybe a Facebook request. All of which I ignore. Including emails asking why I am not replying to him. \n\nThat was several months ago. I just saw him recently at a weekend event. He kind of joined a conversation I was having with someone else, and then he was like \"Oh, are you talking to me now\" and I sort of said meh, shrugged my shoulders and quit talking to him. He did manage to keep his distance after that.\n\nOk, so I feel like I have been SO RUDE to this guy. AITA? And if I am the asshole, why doesn't this guy say \"damn, she is an asshole, I don't want anything to do with her\"?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I moved across the whole Euroasian continent to South Korea, where I now work as one of the higher ups of a large korean company. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the past decade I've been saving about 50% of the money, I've made. Which means after I got out of univesity, I had the money to buy a house, a nice car, etc. The only people who knew I had saved a lot of money, was my girlfriend and my abusive parents and of course my siblings. From the age of 13 I started to get intrested in south korean culture, my parents hired tutors to learn the language, and after a few hardworking years, I became fluent in the language. Life in Sweden for me was miserable, my parents were abusive, but supportive for my ambitions. They'd punish me if I got a grade lower than A, they'd control all aspects of my life. Which made me hate them, they are manipulative sociopaths. They controlled everything in my life. All up, until the age of 20 when I moved away to univeristy. There I met my ex-girlfriend. During that time, I studied a lot, my dream was to move to south korea. I had a lot of friends, but nothing meant more to me than achieve my dreams. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I finished univeristy, last summer. I almost found a job instantly, I moved back to my parents house, until I could find a aparment. It's during this time, I began speaking to this south korean company, through work connections. The small firm I worked for in Sweden, had a lot of shares, bought by the south korean company. Which meant that, we were partially owned by them, and my boss did a lot of affairs with the larger company. It's here where I get in contact with the co-owner of the south korean company, and he had seen my work. And wanted me to come to south korea for a interview, I went.  \n\nWhen I came back to Sweden, they offered me the super high paying position, in the company. I of course accepted in secret. They told me, they'd pay for the flights and offer me suitable housing. It was a dream come true for me. This was in january. \n\nWhen I told my gf I was breaking up with her,  she started crying. And asked why, I didn't say any reasons. All I knew was that I had a new life waiting for me, on the otherside of the world. A few days later, after I'd packed my things. Said up my position at my job in sweden, and told my parents that I was going on a work trip. I only needed little clothing with me to south korea anyway.  When I got to south korea, packed my things. Deleted all my social media, blocked all my family, friends, numbers. Changed mine.

I hung out with the boys (my son is 10) and made them breakfast and took them for a long walk to visit my wife at work to give her some time alone. I assumed she was just tired from her trip and didn't remember to ask if I would take him for the morning. during our morning together I noticed that little bro has a big cursing problem and will typically respond to surprise with an \"oh fuck\" like it came natural to him.

The following morning was more of the same with her sleeping in without asking if it was okay to watch little brother. Wife was with the baby in the back of the house putting her down for a nap and I went to use the bathroom around 9:30 when I hear the boys stomping and screaming really loudly. I went out to reprimand them but my wife beat me to it and gave them both a good talking to. I asked her to go get MIL up to help with her child. She came out complaining and saying \"my son needs to be watched, what did you expect?\" she also claimed that my son taught her son to swear (after admitting the previous night that he had problems with cursing) then came the attitude for the rest of the day.

Soon enough more and more people started coming at the same time as us and because she has some issues with anxiety, uncomfortable feeling towards and being scared of all boys, we started actually going to the gym less and less; opting to just hang at hers instead. This carried on off and on for a good few months, with us sometimes being able to use the gym instead of us driving away once we saw the parking lot having too many cars. Throughout this whole ordeal I admittedly have felt annoyance at the whole thing. Her reasoning being that she feels like everybody is watching her and that makes her really uncomfortable and what-not. I tried telling her that they're just doing their own thing, etc to which she replies that she knows that but her mind will still think that so she will still have that feeling. I generally accept that and usually we cancel gym for tonight and instead go to McDonalds to get her a frozen coke to make her happy and then just chill at her's until I gotta be home for my curfew. \n\nRecently we cancelled our membership with that gym and signed up to a new one that has much more space and is definitely better. We knew coming into this that the gym would be more busy as it's a more popular gym and what-not. Ever since we signed up almost two weeks ago now, the first couple nights since the membership we didn't enter because she saw quite a few people (mainly men) working out through the window so she couldn't enter at all whatsoever. That night I was like okay, I understand and drove off. The following night we managed to get out off the car and was about to swipe our cards to open the doors when she noped out and said she couldn't do it.

She got quite upset with me for that and I tried to explain to her it's because we were so close and all she needed was just that one more step, but she wasn't having it. Shortly after I managed to convince her into trying again somehow, I am usually very shit with my words and mess things up but I succeeded this time. This time we got in and it was great.  \n\nFrom then on, we manage to get in the gym but we usually have to wait in the car until the person who just arrived gets in the gym before us, or any people outside enters/leaves and are out of the parking lot. I'm fine with this as it's just a minute or two thing, no drama there. It's just to further elaborate on how she is. \n\nWhen we're in the gym we typically do five mins of cardio and use that time to gauge how many people are leaving/entering the gym and whatnot, and to give the area we want to go to that little bit more time just to see if the people in there leaves within that time frame. If they don't, we either go to the weight room where all the heavy weights and machines are and sorta work out there half-assed, not really amounting to anything. Last night when we went, and a couple of times actually, she expressed that she feels uncomfortable and that she wants to go/sit in the car and that just makes me feel disappointed because I want to work out with her, and annoyed because I know and she knows nobody is looking at her but she just can't get her mind to think that too. Sure every now and then people look around and look for a few seconds but that's nothing (to me), to her that's uncomfortable and I understand why.  \n\nTo sum it up, would I be the arsehole for feeling annoyed/disappointed at my girlfriend? It's been happening for over half a year and admittedly neither of us have made progress besides me being able to do one pull up now. I feel as if we're not getting the best out of the gym because of how she feels during these times. She expressed many times she wants a big butt and to not be skinny as hell and whatnot, but she's also letting herself halt her progress, we both believe that she needs more confidence as that's a big thing that she's lacking (she said) and I agree.

It happened a few years back. \n\nI went to a diner that I frequent quite often, and the waitress (we will call her... Fred, I don't know.) and I had struck up a decent rapport after a few visits. She was cute, funny and very.... clumsy? But in a good way. She would always say things like, \"god, I'm so dumb! Sorry, sorry!\"\n\nSo, I always give a good tip, but I thought I would tip more than usual on this one occasion because we had a pretty decent conversation and it had been a good day at work (for once!)Basically -- the conversation in question went like this (I'm \"John\"):\n\nMe: \"Here's uh, here's a little something extra for you to... you know, sweeten the pot.\"\n\n\\*\\*yes, I'm awkward as fuck\\*\\*\n\nFred: \"Ha, thank you John. You're spoiling me.\"\n\nMe: \"Well, you know. You do great service, seriously.\"\n\nFred: \"Thank you.\"\n\nMe \"Anyway I was thinking uh, since maybe we have known eachother for, you know, over a week. I was thinking that maybe we could go like.. on a date. Together, like... water slide or something. You like those?\"\n\nFred: \"Oh you know what... I'm really sorry John. I thought you knew? I have a boyfriend.\"\n\nMe: \"You have a boyfriend? You gotta be kidding me. Why didn't you say something? I've beeen coming here for over a week.\"\n\nFred: \"I just thought you knew.\"\n\nMe: \"Well you're not wearing a sign. That's ridiculous. I want my money back. My tip money\"\n\nFred: \"What? You're kidding, right?\"\n\nMe: \"No. I gave you a lot more tips than... somebody I wasn't interested in. I think at least part of that tip money is mine.\"\n\nFred: \"You HAVE to be kidding me. That's just ridiculous.\"\n\nMe: \"How come you're not dumb anymore?\"\n\n\\----\n\nAt this point, I just pretty much left to go sulk somewhere. I know some of my behavior was wrong, but I can't shake the fact that she was playing a \"dumb\" act all along and took advantage to some degree.\n\nAnyway -- let me know what you think so I can stop having flashbacks of this awkward moment and wondering where to go from here. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

It was more often - monthly? - but since they were married in 2014 Mark has kinda dropped off the radar. Sarah is very much a \"Princess\" and very spoiled. She and I literally have NOTHING in common. Mark is a total braggart and always needs to one-up his friends.The last time we went to their home for dinner (to meet the baby when he was a few months old) I reached my boiling point and ended up getting into a disagreement (not heated) with Mark over how he was disciplining his dog (I run a dog rescue and he was shocking him with a shock collar on a remote and as a result the dog, whom he's raised since a puppy and is happy to tell you how BRILLIANT he is, was now a totally unhinged lunatic. He also flicked the tips of his ears if he didn't listen to him and the dog was visibly afraid of him. He calls it \"respect\"). I told my husband that I didn't want to go to their home anymore to listen to him brag about his house/cooking/baby/what-have-you and watch him abuse his dog. If he wanted to get together elsewhere like a restaurant, fine. Husband has been out him once or twice since for a guys' night with a handful of friends.\n\nWe are very child-free by choice. I dislike children pretty strongly and prefer not to be around them if I can avoid it. There are also no children in his family or mine so it hasn't been an issue.\n\nHusband saw Mark recently at a guys' night and we were invited to their baby's upcoming christening. UGH. Between Mark's stag and their wedding we've easily given them $1,000 in cash just for those two events. Their culture is very 'cash only' when it comes to these events.\n\nI don't want to go. They're all Catholic and I'm an atheist and am strongly against organized religion and the Catholic church in general.\n\nI told my husband I didn't want to go, but he's welcome to. He can say I already have plans that day. He has said he has no interest in going, but probably will \"out of obligation\". He said \"if you don't go that's fine, but it will look really bad\". I said, \"to who?\" and he couldn't answer. To them? Who cares? To their families? Literal strangers to me. I told him it's time to stop doing these things (like becoming someone's godparent for no other reason than to give them cash gifts at Christmas, their bday and Easter - WTF?) out of obligation.

For those that don't know, SW boards in groups only and you don't have assigned seating. You are simply assigned a group and then a number. Groups are A, B, and C and the numbers go from 1-65 (or so). If you are given A 25 you are typically the 25 person aboard the plane, give or take (but the exact numbers aren't important here).\n\nOur meal was a little late prior to boarding so I went ahead and decided to board ahead of my family. As we have done countless times before, I'd just hold a couple seats for them as I know they were right behind me. I had boarding letter/number A45. Southwest flies nothing but 737s with three variations. You either have 143 or 175 seats available. \n\nI sat down in an aisle seat and threw my jacket over the middle and window arm rest. Two minutes later a young woman stopped at my seat, looked at me and said \"I want to sit there.\" pointing at the window seat. I politely said \"Oh, sorry, I'm trying to save these for my son and wife who are not far behind you. Her reply - \"So?\" I said \"But, 60% of the plane is still empty.

Given the characteristics of the players involved, me uttering a single word would have lead to an international incident - that I am sure of. \n\nAITA for moving here? Should I have stood my ground? I get it - open seating. But the plan was, again literally, less than half full at this point. I have been flying for business for over 25 years. I'm quite sure that I have flown more than 85% or more of the general population. Not a fact I am proud of, just a little background to say that I know flying sucks, I know the rules and I also know that sometimes common courtesy supersedes some of the basic rules of boarding. \n\nI am also quite sure that this young lady feels that this was a major victory for the patriarchy, toxic masculinity, stupid old people... whatever battle she is waging (that nobody even knows she is involved in), but, seriously?\n\nTL;DR - Tried to save two seats (middle and window) on a Southwest flight for my family.

She's a great friend in many ways - outgoing, bright, and caring.\n\nMy friend has a history of ED (eating disorder), and based on what she described, I think she suffered from bulimia. She also mentioned that she still occasionally binge eats at night but that it wasn't serious. I don't judge her at all for it, and was just happy that she trusted me enough to confide in me.\n\nNow, the problem I have is the stuff she says and does when we're eating together. We frequently have meals together at our university cafeteria. Recently, she's been getting a salad for every meal and compares it to what I eat (usually some bread, soup, meat, rice - I like diversity), saying things like, \"You eat so little!\", \"Look how HUGE my salad is compared to your food!\", or \"You should eat more like me, I'm so stuffed!\" Granted, her salads are pretty big and fills up her entire plate so visually they do look 'bigger' than my food. However, her meal is basically just a ton of lettuce and veggies with no dressing - I can't imagine it being more filling than what I eat. \n\nMy frustration hit a peak yesterday when we dined out for dinner. Again, she ordered a salad while I got a steak gyro. I wasn't really that hungry so I ate half and packed up the remaining to eat later.

You hardly ate anything, girl!\" I was kind of embarrassed and told her that I was full to which she said, 'Yeah right, you ate so little! I'm really worried about you.\"\n\nTbh, I felt (and still feel) so annoyed by that. My friend is around the same weight, if not thinner than me so I don't know she feels the need to constantly judge the size of my meals and feel 'worried' that I'm not eating enough for her standards; after all, without wanting to sound insensitive, I'm not the one with a history of ED!\n\nIt's gotten to the point where I feel strangely guilty if I don't eat a lot in front her. I hate stuffing myself, but I make an effort to clean off my plate every time I dine with her just so that she won't nag me to eat more.\n\nI'm tempted to just not eat with her anymore, though we'd still hang out in other ways.

		"story": "Throwaway.\n\nAlmost everywhere I go people seem to find a way to ruin my day and I'm afraid that it's getting to a point (or maybe it's been there for awhile?) where it negatively affects the relationships in my personal life as well as my self esteem.\n\nA few examples:\n\nThis past week my girlfriend and I took a trip to Disney World to celebrate her graduating her masters program.  If there's anywhere on Earth where I've encountered more inconsiderate, clueless individuals I cannot remember.\n\nFrom what my parents tell me--as I was too young to remember at the time--Disney has really stepped up their game as far as making things quick and accessible for their guests to enjoy the parks and resorts.  We had free shuttles to essentially anywhere we needed to go and could monitor wait times for the various rides through their app.  I was really impressed.  But I was much less impressed with their patrons.\n\nOn one of the busses to a park one morning, a girl maybe seven or eight years old and her parents took the three seats next to us, with the girl sitting directly on my right.  As the windows were behind us and my girlfriend pointed out something off in the distance I had to turn my head to see.  As soon I did this girl turned toward me and coughed the phlegmiest fucking cough straight into my face.  I don't mean a loogie or anything but I was definitely hit with some spit and a lot of her hot ass breath.  I kinda recoiled and the girl seemed to realize what happened but wasn't really mentally mature enough to respond in an empathetic way.  It annoyed me mostly for the fact that we had just gotten there the day before and I really didn't want to spend the rest of the trip sick.  But that's not what got to me.\n\nIt was a complete accident and something I would normally try to save face for but after I'd gotten my face dried off this girl continues to hack up slugs without covering her mouth on the extremely crowded bus.  Her parents sit there chatting and say absolutely nothing to her as she just holds her tongue out her damn mouth and wheezes while I try to hold my breath for the next ten minutes until I can breathe fresh air again.  I'm just sitting there stewing in anger and already feel like my day has reached a breaking point.  When we were exiting I kind of gave the girl a dirty look which she noticed, but it was like a reflex not even an intentional thing.\n\nThere are definitely some things at the park that pissed me off, too.  People stopping walking in the middle of busy areas.  People on scooters driving directly down the middle of narrow foot traffic lanes and lanes for the rides which they then get off their scooters for and immediately hop back on to depart (and I don't mean people with actual handicaps that need assistance for any of this, I mean the ones that seem to fly solo dolo).  Parents with fucking newborn babies out in direct sunlight.  These things may not individually bring me down but they seem to compound into anger that gets directed unfairly towards my girlfriend.  And I don't mean that I get pissed at her directly but just that my anger will sometimes prevent us both from having what should be a good time.  I think what gets me the most is that the people around me don't seem to get annoyed about these things either.  It's like I'm the only one getting upset and now I'm starting to think I may just be the asshole and everyone else has accepted reality when I can't.  The trip was barely spoiled by any of this and we did have a really great time together.\n\nThe bus situation may seem very one-sided so here's another.  On the plane ride home this morning my girlfriend and I each had an aisle seat across from each other.  It wasn't ideal but it was fine for us in case one of us had to go to the bathroom we could just get up and go, no problem.  Well along comes this family of four, taking up two of the seats in the row in front of me and the two seats next to me.  I let the father and younger son climb in and his son takes the window, saying something along the lines of, \"You know how often I have to pee.\"  I just figured maybe I'd just have to get up a few times throughout the flight to let this kid piss.  It was a 2 1/2 hour flight and liquids can travel fast.  \n\nNow, I have to mention that flying has always made me uneasy despite the evidence to its safety and I do tend to get a bit motion sick.  So, we take off and just reach cruising altitude when the flight crew announces like always to remain seated until the seatbelt light goes off.  Well about thirty seconds later I hear the kid say that he has to go to the bathroom so his dad asks me get up.  I point up to the light and say, \"The seatbelt light is still on.\"\n\nHe responds, \"Well he could get up or just urinate here on you,\"\nlike I'm the one being unreasonable.\n\nI just muttered, \"Jesus Christ,\" to myself and got up because I didn't want to deal with a confrontation two minutes into a flight with a decent length.  Well about a minute later the guy's other son who is sitting in front of me also gets up and follows his brother to the back of the plane and not two seconds later the flight attendant is on the horn with the reminder about staying seated.  But they don't actually do shit.  These kids just walk by them through the aisle.  The seatbelt light was on pretty much the entire flight and people continued to get up and use the bathroom with no reprimanding or anything.  We definitely hit a few bumps along the way, too.  Luckily the kid came back and held it for the rest of the flight but why the fuck do people think that it's okay to do that?  I don't want to have my seatbelt unbuckled and then all of a sudden smack my damn skull on the ceiling of the plane.  I get that people have to pee but I don't want to risk a concussion or worse for that shit.  Again, I just kinda stewed in my seat and mentally shook my head at these daredevils until we were off the plane.\n \n So am I the asshole here?  Is it a dick move to let these things get to me?  Occurrences like these are frequent in my life, where I think I'm being fair but somehow it comes back on me like I'm the one at fault.  Should I just have gotten up and let that kid piss?  Do other people just take coughs to the face with an \"oh, well, things could be better\" attitude?  I really don't want to be the asshole at the happiest place on Earth but if I am I need to know.",

Essentially, I struggle with mild drug abuse and it is my go to when I’m extremely anxious and depressed. For the last year or two I’ve had a great friend who was extremely supportive through all this. One night, while mixing alcohol and ambien to cope I mentally disconnected and walked to my friend’s house and just entered their home without their knowledge. This is a horrific thing I did and I feel profound remorse and guilt for it. They cut me out and we haven’t been friends since. \n\nNow we have three classes together at university, so I see them fairly often. We also live just two doors apart from each other. We agreed to act normal in person, and thus far we have. The other day we ended up just sitting and talking for half the day while we did school work in the lab. We had normal personal convos and shared shit. So that part has remained true. \n\nBut today I asked if we could have a smoke tomorrow and that I’d bum them one. They snapped and said “We are not friends. If playing chess is too familiar I will stop.” (Because we still play chess together on the phone). To which I just said “Jesus Christ. I know we aren’t friends. If anything Chess reinforces that. I wasn’t asking out of friendship or some shit so dont treat me like I’m some monster. I dont deserve that” Blah blah blah. They just said “So don’t ask to hang outside of a professional setting” I explained I just had a question to ask and I figured a smoke would be fine because its quick and we’ve smoked together a few times since we stopped being friends. \n\nBut then I followed up and asked for clarification on just how bad I fucked up (not worded in this way but essentially the same thing). Like we once actively expressed love for each other and we’re very caring and supportive of one another. I know what I did was bad and unhealthy, but I didn’t think it was enough to kill everything we ever shared and to fill them with enough hatred and anger that it killed the love and care we once shared. Is this an asshole thing to ask? They left me on read here and didn’t respond. But I’m thinking about asking again next time the chance permits in person. \n\nBut I just don’t know. I feel guilt, I know I fucked up, I know I’m unhealthy, but I dont think I deserve to be treated with the same level of hatred that they give to the people that have literally assaulted them in the past. So the level of guilt and pain I have isn’t to that level, but if they feel that what i did was that horrid then they deserve for me to know that. ",

This morning, we were playing a game of Smash.\n\nPersonally, I prefer to play Smash, and this means that we I am a lot better at it than her. I also had it on 3ds, meaning that I was very familiar with it. The last time she had played a game of Smash Brothers was Brawl when we had a Wii. She didn't really enjoy playing that game either.\n\nWe were playing a few games when the incident happened. I had been winning for the past few rounds, and she had gotten visibly angered. Lana blamed her lack of winning on the fact that I was getting a lot of items. In the moment, she actually said that I was \"stealing\" the items and taking them from her. I had never actually thought of it in that way, as I was just acting on my instinctual knowledge of the game. I tell her that I was not stealing the items, but just picking them up. I got infuriated that she did not blame herself for her own lack of skill, but me. This meant that I probably didn't say it as kindly as I could have.  This did not cheer her mood.\n\nWe play at least 1 more game, and of course, I win. She then puts down the joycon, and walks out of the room.

I had to take some sort of psych test and an interview for a job. In the interview the person I was talking to said that I scored a little high and wanted me to head to Boise to take a more in depth test. So I came home told my parents and told them when I was headed down (we live in Oregon). My mom had shopping to do and my dad was checking out a new car so they came with me. They dropped me off where I was supposed to take another test. It didn't take too long to get in and take it. After that was done a therapist called me into his office and gave me different ranges for how severe somebody's depression was. He said severe was considered 90-110 and I had scored a 120+, he then proceeded to tell me he would not recommend me for the job. Not only that but he recommended me to start therapy and medication. After all this I left the building and called my mom to tell her I was ready for her to pick me up. When they showed up I told them about my issues. This is the first time my parents had heard anything about it, and my dad kept trying to convince me I was fine for the next few hours as my mom still had shopping to do. That night I drove home in the new car while my parents took my dad's truck home. When we got home we had yet another several hour discussion about where I was in life. And my dad seemed to finally accept what was going on.\n\nFast forward a few months, im now 19, I have a full time job and i had started therapy (which I was paying for). It was helping a bit but it wasn't changing how I was feeling for the most part. So i set up an appointment with a doctor so i could see if i needed meds. When i went in I told the doctor what was going on he asked me some question and told me he was going to start me off on a low dose of citalopram, from there he slowly worked me up through the weeks until we found a dosage that helped. Throughout this process I didn't tell me parents, not because I was intentionally leaving them in the dark but I had moved out and was paying for all of this myself. At some point I was staying at their house for the night and I brought a bottle of my pills so I wouldn't miss a day.

She, in my opinion, was creative but lacked in drawing ability, but I kept this to myself until we were setting up schedules for our senior year of high school. I was invited, face to face, by my art teacher to take AP Art during my senior year if I wanted to, but, as it was going to be a new class, she didn't know what it would be like. She told me specifically that she only wanted to pick people that she thought would pass, as she wasn't going to be the one to grade it, but the school board was. She explained to me that it wouldn't be much of a learning experience, but more so a class to build a portfolio for art school. I planned on going to a medical school for psychology, so I ended up declining.\n\nTiffany, who was *not* invited to take AP Art, kept bringing it up how much she would like to take AP Art and that it was her dream to go to art school. I don't want to lie to people and push their hopes too high, so I just kind of told her that it sounded like a cool idea and that I hoped it works out for her. For the next two weeks, she proceeded to talk to our art teacher, whom I'm actually close with, about AP Art and if she would be able to take it next year. Our art teacher, at first, tried to spare her feelings and told her that Art 3 would be a lot more fun and that she should take it instead, but Tiffany insisted that she wanted to take AP Art each time, only for our teacher to ask her to bring in some art that she could see and decide if she could. Tiffany never would bring in the art she promised, but always tried to show off her mostly empty sketchbook (besides a few unfinished anime heads and bodies with no good sense of anatomy), to which our art teacher said wasn't really enough to really tell whether or not she was ready. Our art teacher and I both knew she really wasn't, and so she just pushed her to take Art 3 instead.\n\nTiffany would then try to talk to me about how stupid our teacher was and that she *deserved* to be in AP Art. Eventually, I got sick of her complaining, and I got mean. She called our teacher a terrible artist with no sense or talent, and I snapped and told Tiffany that her art was lackluster and that if our teacher felt that she wasn't ready to take AP Art, then she probably wasn't.

My mom got together with this boyfriend around March of last year, and because of some money issues, moved in with him just a few months later. I didn't especially like him at first. He was just a weird person with a stupid sense of humor, and totally didn't understand me at all. Plus, his house was a solid 40 minutes from my school, which sucked. However, over time I came to really enjoy living with him. He was really well intentioned, and had a lot of really cool hobbies that made him an interesting person (vinyl collecting, retro video games, art, making electronic music, MTG, and even more). I really enjoyed being with him. However, come May of this year, my mom broke up with him and cut all contact with him. Their relationship had been seemingly sort of rocky for a but, but I figured that it would be ok. However, they did break up, and after the break up, my mom said that he was emotionally and verbally abusive. I noticed that he would cry quite a bit, but I chalked this up to just him being emotional. I now think that this may have been manipulation, but I'm not 100% sure. He would also say some pretty demeaning stuff to my mom when he was angry, but my mom topped him in that regard. Apparently, he would also kick her out of the house after fights when me and my sister weren't there, which I didn't know until after the break up. That's all I know, but there may have been more abuse that I didn't know about. Either way, all contact was cut with him, and we moved on. My mom was homeless for a bit after this, so I stayed with my dad, who confirmed that the boyfriend was abusive. Eventually my mom got an apartment, and the relationship was never really mentioned, except occasionally by my mom to roast him.\n\nThat's the backstory. 2 weeks ago or so, I confessed to my mom that I missed her ex boyfriend. The time I lived with him holds this special place in my head. It was the happiest I've ever been, the closest I've ever been to my family, the best I've been treated by any adult ever. I loved being with him. I miss the days where I'd play the PS2 with him. I miss his cat. I miss my old bedroom. I miss his yard. I miss him coming to cheer me on at my soccer games. My life isn't bad now, but it was great back then. And I confessed some of this to my mom. She freaked out at me for it, called him an abusive piece of shit, and said that I was just as bad for missing him the way I do. She took my phone away, and specifically said she won't get me the Christmas present I wanted the most. She's still mad at me for it, and I understand why, but at the same time, I don't.

I suggested that I should receive a small cut if they sign a deal. My wife thinks that's not what friends do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFull version: this weekend I was helping out with some manual work to my wife's friend, let's call him David. In a month he wants to leave his day job and start his real estate enterprise, which would involve finding apartments, buying them, finishing them up himself (or renovating) and either selling them for a higher price or furnishing them and renting their rooms. I'm no expert in it but he does seem to know his thing and, from what my wife tells me, David and David's wife are quite the venturesome types. Even though they have two small kids, they also started a small side-business a few years ago (while also working full-time jobs) which they intend to sell in a year or two to focus on real estate. David is looking for investors, since he doesn't yet have the financial capacity to buy multiple apartments himself and really kick it off.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter hearing this, I reached out to an old friend of mine, let's call him George. George been very successful in the past 15 years and is definitely a millionaire, likely a multimillionaire by now. He's by far the smartest person with money that I know. He's been a good friend of mine but we don't live in close vicinity so nowadays we see each other 2-3 times a year and speak too little on the phone for me not to have a guilty conscious about it. Anyway, during the past few years, he also started to invest in real estate but doesn't know our local market. He invests mostly abroad and if it's local, he lives in a completely different part of the country anyway so he focuses on his operations there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBoth gentlemen seemed very keen in talking to each other. If not to strike a deal then at least to exchange experiences. George is starting very slowly, since he's currently got his main business to run and David wants to go all in within the next few months but is only on his first investment now.

She’s obsessed with it, she’ll watch every episode at least twice when it comes out, rewinds to watch her favorite scenes multiple times and reads fanfics all the time. \nThe show is based on a book series and I read the entire series back in high school.  The show is incredibly different and it’s not my cup of tea. \n\nAnyway, since I was familiar with the characters I would talk to her about them sometimes (book vs show) etc. Soon the show was literally all she could talk about, she would go on for hours at dinner and send me long paragraphs ranting and fan-girling over the show. I listened and engaged in the beginning. But I would change the subject, letting her know I was bored and hope she would get a hint. She did and we would talk about other things when we hung out.\n\nThen the show got cancelled over the summer and that’s when she went back to her old self, she told me to support the show, call the network and ask them to not cancel it. She made a Twitter to try and save the show and urged me to do the same. I was sympathetic but a bit relieved that I wouldn’t have to listen to her rant anymore. Over the past couple of months she brings it up occasionally and I’ve told her straight up that I don’t care and I don’t want to hear it. She would still bring it up - “I know you don’t care but blah blah blah...” \n\nWe had our spring break last week and decided to go to NYC. I couldn’t go sightseeing one of the days where they (her and one of our other friends) visited Central Park. There’s a bench there dedicated to the show and she sent me a huge paragraph fangirling with articles about how the actors were there and all.\n\nThis is what I told her - “look I admire how much you like this show (I was taking about how passionate she is) but I simply don’t care and I’ve heard you talk too much about them that I low key hate them even more now”\n\nHer response- “You literally just broke my heart”\n\nSo, AITA?

Went back to his place watched a movie and cuddled and made out a little (didn’t do anything else). I wouldn’t say he was the best kisser, but a lot of the time I felt like he didn’t know what he was doing. Second date we went out to dinner again and ended back at his place, things were getting hot and heavy but then he went soft. He actually admitted he had PE while we were making out on the couch. And when we did have sex i literally could not feel anything. He apologized and I told him that it happens to everyone and to text me again when he’s back in town (he had to go on a business trip for about a week). And we’re texting the whole time and I thought it was going well. Plot twist was that I got an UTI so I had to wait for that to go away. So he comes back to town and we end up going on the third date, we go out to dinner again and it was okay and we go back to his place. But this time I noticed that I was being a little more distant and we watch another movie. Then we head upstairs and start having sex again, but I had this horrible pain, like I couldn’t continue so he basically just fingered me. And I kinda got the feeling he was less experienced then he was letting on.\n\nAfter the awkward sex both times, I texted him the next morning basically saying we were lacking chemistry and that it wasn’t really gonna work. I still liked this guy, but sexual compatibility is important too. So about two weeks later I texted him , being rather blunt and asking if he wanted to try again and work on our sexual incompatibility &amp; I got ghosted. I get no one likes being told they suck at sex, but it’s rarely just one sided and I genuinely wanted to work on it together. \n\nThis was what I texted after a couple exchanges“Ok honestly I'm not interested in just being friends, i just felt like we were both struggling with our sexual chemistry. And I wanted to know if you'd be down to work on it together. If not that's fine, we can just be friends.”\n\nTLDR: I broke up with a guy from tinder after two awkward hook ups, but I told him I wanted try again last week.

The rules in the dorm state that after 11pm we have to be quiet and people of the opposite sex has to be in their rooms.\n\nShe is really hypersocial and has people over all the time. Which I don't mind in the daytime, but it can be a huge disturbance in the evenings when I'm trying to sleep, especially when her friends or boyfriend sleep over.

He talked with her, and for a few days she was nice and respectful. She got no punishment even though I told him she'd been breaking the rules. Then she continued like before with the sleepovers. Last night she had the TV on a bit loud, so I messaged her word for word: \"turn down the volume\" and the follow up \"hello?\" after a few minutes with no reaction. After a few minutes she turned off the TV and started having sex. I could hear the bedsprings and the wood creaking, and they're normally not vocal, but this time I could hear the boyfriend moaning loudly. I messaged her again, saying \"are you kidding me?\". No response to the messages until this morning when she wrote a really long and kind of angry message about how she's tried to please me and be respectful and that she has to be allowed to watch TV without me becoming angry. She said she doesn't understand why I'm living there if I can't handle her noise. We went back and forth for a bit, and I get the impression that she's turning the situation around on me. She did make me feel very bad, hence why I'm posting.

In this situation, you were justified in seeking clarity on your boyfriend's behavior, but it’s essential to ensure both partners feel comfortable with the level of privacy and access to personal belongings. If boundaries are crossed, it can lead to further conflict, so strive for honest discussions about trust and respect in the relationship."

Myself, including most of my friends, did not have a car on campus. Thus, we would have to walk about 15 minutes to the nearest gas station to purchase packs of Juul pods. This wasn’t always a problem, but sometimes rain or cold weather would make this trek difficult. \n\nTherefore, it became common to buy pods off of other people. For example, someone would ask in a dorm groupme if anyone had a pod they could sell. I would often use these group chats or my friends who juuled for an extra pod. Since it was often difficult to find someone, I had a great idea. If my roommate, who did not Juul, began Juuling, then I would have another person who I was close friends with and in close quarters with for pod purchasing.\n\nI began by offering my roommate to hit my Juul. More and more, she would start hitting it. Also, several of our friends in our circle were Juuling often, so they began encouraging her too.

I tell them that if they don’t find a place for him by the end of the week I will leave him tied to the railing of the rescue coordinator’s house (empty threat, but they didn’t know that).  Magically by the end of the week, they find an adopter for him, and tell me they will no longer use me as a foster parent and cut all ties. Suffice to say I wasn’t interested in working with them anymore either. \nAITA, because I no longer wanted to devote my time and money to a volunteer position that wasn’t working out and that could have been resolved if the rescue was doing their job, advertising the dog and placing him elsewhere if his current placement wasn’t working out?\n",

We met via Tinder. \n\nWe ended up sleeping together on the 4th date (I'm easy, I know) and honestly it just o.k. so I mildly ghosted him [still responding to msgs but not flirting, telling him I don't want to hang out again, etc]\n\nOn Saturday I was at a bar/pub with a group of friends in Big City. Turns out he was there with his band and some guys he used to play football with. I know others in his band so I waved at the group, smiled at him and went on my merry way to get lit with my good friend Jose Cuervo.\n\nAbout 30 minutes later, I went over to chat with some friends in his group and he starts getting louder and louder spouting gibberish until I hear \"WHAT A WHORE.\" I stopped mid-conversation and looked at him, and he's staring straight at me. He starts spouting off some rude shit that I can't remember but I remember being shocked at what was coming out of his mouth. Stuff along the lines of \"your face just hides your shitty body\" and something about how much better he could do than me. \n\nHe stopped and I was pissed at this point, so I came out with \"You should know you're EASILY the smallest I've ever been with. And the sex fucking sucked.\"\n \nTwo things: I was about 2 rounds of Jose in at this point, am naturally loud and the music died out right as I started saying it. Everyone within a 4 table radius heard, and a few people burst out laughing. The girl he was sitting beside mildly side-eyed him and moved closer to his other friends. Our mutual friend leaned over and whispered that I should probably leave now, and I went to a different bar with some friends and drank the rest of the night away. \n\nSince then, he's been messaging me and calling me a bitch for calling him out like that and he was just about to get laid but I fucked it up for him and I need to learn to keep personal shit like that to myself.\n\nI feel like I was justified after the abuse, but I'm kind of starting to feel bad. \n\nAITA?\n\nTL;DR - slept with a guy, saw him at a bar, he said mean things, i said equally mean things. he had a small peen.",

		"story": "This is my first post on reddit EVER but y’all seem cool and this has been on my mind for a long time.\n\nTo explain some necessary backstory, here ya go. My parents got divorced when I was around 6 years old and the court decided that my sister (3 years older than me) and I were to see my father every Monday and every other weekend. Things were going relatively well for a few years until I was nine. It was at this time where things started to get tense and to the point where my sister decided to stop visiting my dad. The reason for this is because our stepmom treated my sister so horribly that she couldn’t stand being around her anymore. And to make matters worse, our father never stood up for my sister. Our mom respected my sisters decision to stop visitation and so from that point forward, I visited my dad on my own.\n\nOnce I was 12, the same thing that had happened to my sister started to happen to me. The cruel treatment and the absence of my fathers support. Therefore, I decided to stop visiting as well because the treatment was too horrible and I felt neglected and unprotected. \n\nAfter that, I lived with my mom full time until I was almost 18 when some financial struggle had forced us out of our home. My family moved to another state that was cheaper but that left me in my home state to finish my last few months of high school. I thought the best possible thing was to ask my father if I could live with him so that I could finish high school. \n\nMy father decided that we would talk about it over dinner with his wife. The dinner was awkward (It was like an interview). And seeing your father after years of separation and after puberty is very alien. Anyways, they decided that I could live with them.  \n\nLife at their house was fine for the first couple months but then towards the end, my step mom began to criticize everything in my life. Literally all my relationships (my mom &amp; sister, girlfriend, friends, teachers). This made everything hard because at that age I was very easily manipulated and so I almost lost all of those relationships. \n\nThen college acceptances came around and I got into the college I had been interested in and I told my dad and stepmom I wanted to go. Instead of encouraging me to go the college (which the has been doing before I got the acceptance), they said that I should stay and not go to college. That I could get a job at home and work on my relationship with my father. When I insisted that I was going to go to the university, they said I had been using them and lying to them this whole time. And said that I was manipulating them for my own gain. Also adding that I wouldn’t be able to support myself and succeed in a university. They topped it off by saying if I accepted the admission that I would be kicked out of the house.\n\nI accepted the admission and was kicked out the next morning.\n\nAITA?\n\nI’m open to questions\n\nTLDR: I chose to go to college instead of rekindling my relationship with my father.

		"story": "This may get long, I will try to summarize at the bottom.\n\nTechnically, there are 3 potential assholes in this scenario, as 2 siblings (Sister and Brother) we my co-conspirators.\n\nSome Background:\n\nMy mother is somewhat neglectful and absolutely narcissistic. When my parents divorced I was 13, and I asked her why she didn’t just let dad have custody and she said to me, “Do you know how society looks at a woman who doesn’t have custody of her own kids?” As an aside, I am also angry at her because I am 35 and just realized I have autism which she probably noticed (she is a doctor) and didn’t seek treatment for because she didn’t want an autistic kid. But I digress.\n\nI do love her. She usually equates love to buying us stuff, and we are used to getting a huge Christmas. Even as adults she usually bought us each something nice we wanted, think washer/dryer or big screen tv.\n\nLast Christmas:\n\nShe prefaced the holiday by starting at Thanksgiving telling us she can’t afford more than $50 each, she wants to do more but can’t, etc. My 3 siblings all have 6 figure incomes and were equally annoyed at this because it is exhausting to watch a doctor who sometimes drops $1000 a week on designer baby clothes for one of the grand kids suddenly claim they are in poverty. We don’t care what she gives us, but don’t want to be guilted.\n\nAbout a week before Christmas she calls me and wants me to help her shop for this family she has adopted. We go out and drop $1500 at Target. She then spends like another grand with my sister at ToysRUs (RIP) Apparently she had a patient come in with a sob story, and instead of referring them to organizations like she should have she decides to help them herself.\n\nI will be honest, I don’t have a six figure income, and at this point was pretty near the poverty line myself. I would be lying if I said I wasn’t wicked pissed about the money. I would like to imagine that if I had more money I wouldn’t have felt this way. But as it was we usually just asked for cash in lieu of a tv or whatever to buy extra Christmas for my own son. When she said she “couldn’t afford” to give me more than $50 it felt like she was saying she couldn’t help me buy my son Christmas because she had to buy it for them instead.\n\nBut I bit my tongue, and even played Santa to her adopted family by delivering the gifts. And in January I asked her to loan me my rent, and she just paid it outright instead so I did get my Christmas present after all, and was very grateful.\n\nFast Forward to This Year:\n\nShe starts again with how she can’t afford Christmas, this time before Thanksgiving.\n\nI asked her to help me buy a stove, because we literally don’t have one. I have cooked on a hot plate and toaster oven for 6 months. She says it’s too much, but I found one for $400 black friday and she agreed to split it with me, but it counts as my spouse’s birthday gift this year and mine next year as well. Cool. I’m so fucking stoked, right?\n\nShe texts the whole family again earlier this week, and I will just include the good parts:\n\nMom, “So the family we helped out last year is asking for help again... They brought me a list of items and I’m wondering if anyone wants to help out? Thank you and if you don't want to just say so no problem.”\n\nSister, “Of course they want help again...\r\nLast year was the best Christmas of their life....Someone should tell them there is no santa”\n\nMe, “1. Told ya. 2. If you don't intend to do the exact same thing every year, until these kids are adults then you need to tell them the truth now, \"That the organization that you contacted last year is out of business.\" 3. I might be offended if you hadn't a. Already bought me a Christmas present and b. Didn't already give me a billion things this year. Let's not forget that you have at least one adult child who lives in poverty as the result of undiagnosed mental illness. But, I digress. And finally, 4. I would be happy to shop with you if you want, and deliver like last year.”\n\nBrother, “Yeah, you should actually help her fill out paperwork for an organization. Probably too late this year but you're basically setting a precedent for every future year 😂”\n\nLater my mom called me:\n\nSo, she calls me and asks why my brother and sister are being assholes, lol. She does this thing where she pretends like one of us wasn’t involved. Not sure the motive, but regardless I pissed her off and she hung up on me. This is basically what I said:\n\n“You justify to us not buying Christmas by saying, “I don’t have money.” Which is EXACTLY what you said to us last year. Then you turned around and dropped $2500 on them. It happened, I was there. So, what we want is honesty. Say to us, “I don’t want to spend my money on you.” And stop bitching about how you have no money. As adults we don’t NEED presents, but you act like you want to give us presents, but are just unfortunately stopped from doing so by the fact that you “have no money.” It clearly isn’t true if you can buy a whole other family Christmas. You asked why my siblings are upset, I explained. I am sorry it offends you.”\n\nHonestly, for my siblings I know it is about feeling neglected, they don’t need money, but can’t help but to hear, “I don’t love you,” when our mother starts bitching about giving us money. She did that to herself through years of not being home. There were whole weeks sometimes when we only knew she had been home because there was a stack of blank signed checks on the table. When she was with us she would just throw money at us.\n\nI’d be lying if I said for me the saltiness wasn’t at least a little about the money. I pawned my husband’s wedding ring today so I could pay rent *and* buy groceries. I did forget to mention mom did say I don’t have to pay for my half of the stove. \n\nWhat I really think I’m most mad about is the way she treated me when I asked her to split the cost of a stove with me, vs. how I know she responded when these relative strangers brought her a *prepared list* to their doctor’s appointment; I’m sure it wasn’t, “oh, boy, I want to, but I can only spend $50 this year.”\n\nWhen I told my bff the story she asked if my mom was taking lists from everybody.\n\ntl;dr: mom offered to help a needy family last year, this year they brought her a prepared list of stuff they wanted expecting her to do it again and it left a bad taste in my mouth, but maybe I’m just jelly?\n",

She didn’t know. She was living in a house close to campus, and the other GameCube was at home. I was looking for a DOL-001, but I would have been perfectly fine with a DOL-101 model. They both play games, and that was just fine with me.\n\nI visited her in December, two days after Christmas. She gave me a box. I opened it up to find a model 101 GameCube. That was just fine with me. The thing is, there were no cables and no power source. It was just a system. She apologized and gave me a controller to make up for it. I said it was fine, and took the GameCube home after I left.\n\nAfter looking for cables and a power source online, I decided to ask a friend of mine, who has a collection of over a thousand games, where a good place to look would be, and if third party parts would be usable (I almost always prefer first party but it’s not always an option). He said third party cables would work fine, but a third party power supply could screw up the image. He didn’t know any other places, and recommended looking for another GameCube.\n\nA few weeks ago, I decided to start looking on eBay for GameCubes, specifically DOL-001 models. I told some friends at the house I live in for their thoughts, and they unanimously said that I was being ungrateful by looking for something someone already took their time to give to me. I tried countering back by telling them that looking for the parts by themselves would be too challenging, and that it’d be easier to get a new GameCube, the same advice my game collector friend told me. I asked my girlfriend about it, and she told me she understands and wouldn’t be offended at all. She also said it'd be nice to use the one she gave me as a backup, should my potential future GameCube fail. That was supposed to settle it, but I’m still being called ungrateful by my housemates, and it's starting to make me think that I might be making a moral mistake.\n\nSo, neutral minds of Reddit, I want to know. Would I be the asshole if I got myself a GameCube?",

Things got pretty involved within three months and we started exclusively dating 9 months ago. She’s gorgeous, wild, hilarious, sweet, and more than I could have ever hoped for\n\nWe’re both pretty laid back and just want the best for each other, and our relationship has done nothing but improve. We’ve both said we never see ourselves breaking up, and love each other so much. I still feel like we’re in the honeymoon phase well over a year later, she’s my best friend and the most incredible person I know\n\nWe’ve never fought, but a few times one of us has fucked up or upset the other and we always just talk it out, work on it, and resolve any issue without fighting. No bickering or petty disagreements\n\n**What happened**\n\nSo today we were talking and she casually mentions that next weekend she’ll be going to formal with a friend at a fraternity we’re both very close with. I’m unaffiliated so I couldn’t ask even if I wanted to. I just want her to be happy and have fun with friends (though I don’t know her date this semestre). I know she would never cheat on me or do anything like that to hurt me, so this didn’t come from a place of jealousy or trying to be controlling. However, it did upset me for a few reasons\n\n1. She agreed to go without even talking to me—same for her date not asking me if it was chill. Like I said I’m totally fine with her going, but it hurt that she didn’t think to ask me how I felt about it considering I can’t take her\n2. I’d love to get out of town for a weekend with her, but I’m really busy with classes and not working, so I can’t afford to blow several hundred dollars to take her somewhere nice for the weekend. I try to do everything I can to make her as happy as I can, and it made me feel kinda shitty that I can’t do something like that for her\n3. We are both super busy with classes and usually can’t find the time to do something nice like this together, but it makes me sad that we finally had a weekend to get out of town and do something special but she’s spending it to go to an event I can’t join\n\nSo I decided to talk to her about it and basically told her what I just told you, as gently as possible. I started tearing up because it’s so hard for me to tell her that something she did upset me when she’s so amasing that I hate to bring it up. She started crying pretty hard and held me and told me she was so sorry and said she didn’t have to go. I kissed her and said it was totally cool with me to go, I just felt upset. I assured her it was okay and told her how much I love her and we just cuddled for a few hours\n\nI really hate bringing up stuff that’s minor and inconsequential, like I said we never bicker over little things that don’t matter. But I can’t help but feel like maybe I was being a petty asshole and making too big a deal out of this\n\nAITA?",

Of course, its hard not to fall in love with him, especially with his humor and intelligence. \n\nWhen I was trying to move on with my boyfriend, our chats casually transformed from words of encouragement to flirts.

But even so, I wanted to take it to another level. As a joke, I invited him to be friends with benefits with me, to have sex with me, but I meant it deep inside. He agreed immediately, saying he doesn't want to be a virgin anymore, and that sex would be the perfect stress reliever from academics. He was even more excited that me. Sexting, video calling, buying condoms, and he even scheduled a hotel for us to do it.\n\nSo we hit it off, it was the happiest day of my life.

I was so happy that I told half of my friends about it, and I know I shouldn't have done that especially for something so private, but I was just so happy that no amount of common sense made me do the most reasonable thing to do. \n\nAfter a week, he blocked me on facebook and twitter. It's been 3 months now and he still hasn't messaged me back. I've said sorry in real life and he still won't start talking to me.

He's on reddit more than me (first time posting, hi) so he will definitely see this. \n\nTo keep the story very short: I met him a year ago - he was my first real boyfriend (I'm f/late 20s) and told me around our 5th date that he had recently started becoming a furry. Wasn't a dealbreaker for me and I really liked him, so we continued dating.\n\nHe started getting more deeply into it, bought two really scary fursuits for 5400€ (glow-in-the-dark eyes, jesus), asked me to have sex in the suits. Again, I accepted. Personally, I'm not into this whole thing at all but he was and I liked him, so it was all okay on my front.\n\nAround our 6-month anniversary, he started to wear the fursuit pretty much all the time apart from work. That started annoying me because it was summer and super hot and more often than not I would end up having to sleep on the sofa because it got so hot in his bed. He got really upset about it and told me he needed me to buy a fursuit as well so we could be 'mates'. I declined (honestly, at that point it was mostly because I didn't have the money - I probably would have done it for him if he'd pestered my long enough).\n\nOur relationship got worse but then my friend from back home asked me and a whole bunch of friends to dinner since she'd recently had a baby. BF was obviously invited.\n\nHe wanted to go in the fursuit and I told him no. He told me I needed to accept him and not be ashamed of him and I told him that we had agreed he could do whatever he wanted in his or my apartment but not during meetings with my family and friends because most of them wouldn't get it and I especially didn't want to have to explain to my grannie and older relatives.\n\nHe accused me of not accepting him, of being an intolerant and racist 'cunt', for not accomodating him and getting a fursuit on my own etcetc. and then broke up with me. He's been guilt-tripping me on social media and amonst our friends ever since and has made me feel horrible bc of this. The first few months afterwards I was honestly really freaking broken up about it and it's only been recently that I've been getting angry instead.\n\n## ",

		"story": "My best friend came out to me as trans roughly 1.5 years ago. She pretty much instantly became hormones but had no surgeries yet. I've known her for only 2-3 years prior to her coming-out due to us both studying literature in Berlin, but we quickly became best friends. These things changed after her treatment started.   \n\n\n1) She's copying me. Not only my style or how I talk, but she'll also hang out with the same friends, have relationship problems when I do, get frustrated with her job when I need to search a new one. All these things would be innocent if they were single events, but the amount of \"coincidences\" is incredible and suspicious.  \n2) Sometimes she's not invited to events. At the start, that just happened (y'know.. sometimes there are group size restrictions, sometimes an old clique meets up after a long time..). On every of these occasions, she would find reason for drama, send me dozens of texts on how the group is excluding her and how this is unfair and any other reason why we should have invited her and how she now feels like shit.   \n3) Very often she wants me to promise to deal with things for her that she can do herself. She almost always agrees that she'll have a change to do it and knows that there is no guarantee I'll do it (its NOT stuff like \"if you go shopping, can you buy xyz for me?\"). I've told her that she basically dumps her responsibilities on me and that it stresses me out, but she simply disagreed and got angry that I denied her simple favors.\n\n4) She has a history of bad friendships and this leads to her often being paranoid and untrusting even towards me. When we plan to meet, she'll double- and triple-check that I'll really go with her. She'll always get a backup even if I promise to be there with her. She'll ask three others to make sure I'll have time and not planned anything with someone else.  \n\n\nBy now, I argue with her at least once a week. She's obviously also getting more annoyed at me or gaining more confidence, as she more and more started to call me out for being a bad friend, not having her back with whatever or how she's disappointed that I don't want to do xyz for her and that I always treat her badly. She also once told me that some of her other friends would urge her that I am an asshole and that she should avoid me, but because she's so nice and believes in our friendship, she still deals with me. I told her in some discussions that if I'm so bad, maybe she should just stop talking to me, but she's refusing. There is also at least on friend who severed his ties to me because he wants to avoid her.\n\nI feel almost constantly pressured into needing to agree with her, think of her, include her, get her into events/parties just to avoid more fights, drama and guilt-tripping. I'm frustrated and stressed, I feel trapped in a friendship thats maybe just not working anymore. \n\nWIBTA if I told her that we should spend less time together and find other friends?",

The rest was from quizzes and such that did not need to be graded by the instructor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe second week of the course, the professor sent out an email saying she had broken both wrists (among other injuries) and might be late on grading. Completely understandable. However, I had just submitted the first essay when this happened and was eager to get feedback so I could fix any problems for future assignments. I've found in college that even when being careful to read the assignment grading rubric, sometimes a student's interpretation of the expectations for the course are not very clear, so feedback is vital to success.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, by the time the 2nd essay was due, the 1st essay was still not graded and no feedback was provided. I understood that, even if I was a bit disappointed. However, by the time the 5th essay was due, the 1st essay and all other essays were still ungraded and no feedback was provided. I was quite annoyed at this point. I could be failing the course without even knowing it and it was approaching the deadline to drop a course. I sent an email pointing this out and asking if there was any way she could dictate the grades to someone else who could type them, etc. She responded in a furious manner and said I wasn't being understanding of her traumatic situation and there was nothing she could do. I felt **mortified** after that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe situation ended up being pretty inconsequential as I passed the class with a good grade. She finally graded everything in the last few weeks of the course (no feedback though).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut really, am I the asshole here? I feel horrible that she was injured, but students pay a lot of money to enroll in university courses. If she wasn't able to provide any kind of feedback, perhaps the class should have been cancelled.

He lives with my elderly grandma and I worry about how much care the two of them are getting. He spends most of his days buying guitars, listening to music, making spreadsheets, and texting my brother and I. He hasn't always been like this, but it started in about late 2016 and has been escalating since then.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn his texts he talks about guitars and music; but mostly talks about being wronged by the doctors he's seen in the past, that America wants to execute the mentally ill, and that no one understands or loves him. He's convinced that if someone moves out there and devotes all their time to care-giving for him, he'll feel better. That's his end goal. On average, he'll send 7 texts (about 10 lines each) every time he texts me. So when I was texting him more often, it would be constant!

In short, it's meant to be taken seriously and everyone who shows up knows this.\n\nThis time a woman attended and had an attitude from the second she walked in with someone else, mentioning to other people that she already knew all of this, all this shit was fake etc. I had asked her what she hoped to achieve by coming, and she said her friend had dragged her along. Ok, whatever. Everyone is entitled to learn.\n\nSo as we're going along she's disrupting, asking sarcastic hypothetical questions clearly meant to challenge my credibility and half-assing the demonstrations with a partner which deprived the women paired with her of their experience.\n\nShe essentially rallied some others into a \"why should we have to learn this, we can protect ourselves\" sentiment, which is a dangerous mindset.

At no point did I do anything to cause her pain, but I was physically overwhelming so it was realistic. She told me to stop, so I did. Take note this is **common practice** with men and women. Hands-on demonstration is essential to learning.\n\nI used the opportunity to teach where she went wrong and what she could have done to the others who were eager to pair up and repeat the drills among themselves. However, this woman took me aside and told me I made her feel humiliated and helpless. I re-iterated the importance of the information and the seriousness of the subject, and told her that the drill was meant to show her the reality of the situation so she'd be open to learning as I don't want her to rely on misconceptions to save her life. She got her friend and left.\n\nI don't think I was an asshole, it was standard practice and misinformation can have terrible consequences. My reaction from women has always been extremely positive because I don't baby those who attend.

The line was right next to the bar and I could see the main dining area. While in line, I saw her already sitting there and I swear my heart stopped.

So what I did was I stepped out of line and looked around the bar. I found a pretty good looking guy who for some reason, was there by himself and I gave him the flowers and my card and told him to have dinner with her that night, which he did. Once he checked in, I left the restaurant and went home and just curled up on my floor (I live in a very small studio and own no furniture)\n\nThe next day, I see her and she appears to be happy.

Everything was going fine the first semester, although there was a slight (but tolerable) odor coming from somewhere in the room.\n\nFast forward to this semester, and I noticed the smell was getting stronger, and i realized that it smelled especially bad after she showered. It seemed like the smell was coming from her towel, and it then clicked- everytime she would leave the dorm on the weekends (I always stayed), she would bring her laundry bag with her, but her towel was never included. Even over winter break, the towel was just hanging, folded up on a hanger by the rest of her clothes.\n\nAfter a few weeks of trying to deal with the smell, I decided I should just let her know. I said something along the lines of \"Hey, can I talk to you for a sec? Lately, I've noticed a smell in the room, and I think it might be coming from your towel...\"  She didn't take it well; she got very defensive and said she didn't smell-- even though i never said she smelled, just that it might be her towel.\n\nSince then, she's been completely silent with me, as well as being very petty/passive aggressive--slamming the doors/coming in the room just to turn on the light and leave while I'm asleep (she knows I'm a very light sleeper). \n\nAnd then today--I woke up this morning and saw her portable heater on in the room, but she was not there. There have been several occasions where she's turned on the heater and just left the apartment, so I decided to turn it off. Turns out she was just in the bathroom, and when she came back to the room, she was angry and said \"please don't touch my belongings.\" I said \"okay, but you turned it on and then left, and it was starting to smell kinda smoky\" (not like burning, but like an overheated-plastic kinda smell). This turned into an argument between the two of us, where she repeatedly said \"I don't touch your belongings, so don't touch mine\" and eventually lead to her calling several people to complain about me, and even called the campus police, saying i was touching her belongings (although avoiding saying what \"belongings\" it was that I touched). I did not wait for the campus police as I had class, and didn't want to stay in the same room as the roommate who had just previously called someone (before the cops) to tell them that she wanted to choke me--while I was still in the room--because I was \"pushing her too far.\" \n\nSo, am I the crazy one here? AITA for turning off her heater? Or for telling her that the room smelled bad?\n\n(Also, first time reddit poster!-- and on I'm on mobile, so I had some issues and you might noticed I submitted/deleted this several times..)",

She asked if I’d take L on a day date, just the 2 of us because she was feeling jealous. I said no because I was recovering from a really traumatic labor and taking care of a newborn baby.

It seems worse in the winter.\n\nOur marriage has never been great, he's always hurt me by never putting me first, not showing me love, having a short fuse with me to the degree I ignore most things because I hate making him angry and stirring the pot. When he gets angry he shuts me out for days, barely speaks to me, sits on the computer for any moment he's not working, etc.\n\nIt got so bad last year that I moved out at the end of August. I stayed with my parents for awhile but In November, he was STILL unwilling to make any changes...all of our talks were getting no where. I finally found a very small and cheap apartment that didn't require a lease or deposit so I figured it was perfect to not be so crowded with my parents, and have a space of my own. When I told him I found a place, he got so angry and swore he'd never give me money, he'd rather take all our savings (30k+ I think, he won't tell me how much) and bury it in the back yard and off himself than see me get any money of \"his\" (All our assets are \"his\" because he has contributed most of money during our marriage). I got so hurt and upset and told him I needed just a bit because I was paying all of the childcare out of MY paycheck as well. He said he'd give me $250 a month and that was it (he makes 60k, I make 27k). I asked for a small chunk ($1000) to get started since I had literally nothing but my clothes to bring with me. He was not budging but I kept persisting and he finally said \"do I need to pay you to leave this house? FINE I'll give you the money.\"\n\nThe next day he apologized for how he acted the previous night and gave me the money and said he would go to couple's therapy with me finally.\n\nNow, we've been in counseling since Mid-December and its improving. We have been spending a lot more time together, he's been more respectful, better with our daughter, better with not being on the computer so much, etc. I'd been planning on moving back home very soon!\n\nIn the past 10 or so days he seems to have hit another major down and has totally shut me out again. Barely any contact for days, nothing nice, got ANGRY at me for sleeping/watching tv all night long after having surgery that day and wouldn't speak to me for DAYS after that, etc.\n\nI know his depression is a sickness. It makes me feel really torn on what to do. If he was a jerk I wouldn't feel so bad. I know not all of it can be helped. I do love him. But my stress this past week has been through the roof. I feel sick all the time, my chest is tight, stomachs a mess.\n\nDo I need to give him more time, more help? I wish he'd see a therapist or get some meds but he won't.

We talked throughout college (we all went separate places) and was able to all meet up a few days ago in Japan for the first time in over 5 years. It was great! We had a lot of fun catching up and hanging out.\n\nWe're all on different schedules right now since we're all doing our own things. My vacation time was over, so I left first and the rest of the group was able to meet up a few more times.\n\nThe 2 other girls and I have our own separate group chat. In it they told me that the 2 boys admitted to cheating on their gfs. One went on an overnight trip with a different girl behind his gf's back. The other basically has 2 girlfriends who obviously don't know about each other. My girl friends said the boys weren't necessarily bragging about cheating, but would deny or change the topic if the 2 girls in our groups called them out for cheating.\n\nWithout going into boring details, life turned out so that I will probably be able to meet those 2 boys again in the near future. But now that I know they're openly(?) cheating on their girlfriends, I don't want to maintain my friendships with them. I dunno, it just makes me uncomfortable. What I specifically want to do is to never schedule time to see them in particular again. If we were in some large group function (like a high school reunion maybe) and I ran into them, I'd be cordial. They already started another group chat with me, but I haven't responded yet.\n\nI told this to the 2 girls. They said I was overreacting. One said she was glad she was friends with them and not dating them. The other said that since we don't know/have never met any of the guys' girlfriends and have no way of contacting them, it's fine. Basically she's saying the situation would be different if the girls being cheated on were people we knew, but since that isn't the case, I don't need to feel uncomfortable remaining friends with the boys.\n\nI consider everyone in this friend group to be pretty good friends. Like I mentioned, we've all been friends since high school, and even though we didn't have the chance to meet up very much in the past, it was just like old times when we finally were able to hang out. I really enjoy talking and keeping in contact with them.\n\nBut AITA for wanting to distance myself from the 2 boys? Am I overreacting?

There is a ton of it online and every time I see something like a figure of star wars or something like that I instantly want it. Looks cool, but mostly not gonna buy it since they can be quite pricey.  \n\n\nMy Parents never really wanted to get me anything like that. As long as I can remember they didn't want me to play video games and always were mad at me when I played them. Naturally now that changed since I was 18, but they still did it in the past and their attitude didn't change about it.  \n\n\nWe had a couple of weeks before Christmas a talk about what to get me for Christmas. My sister got a Mountain Backpack for her trip with her BF to Sri Lanka. And that was about 170 € for that. So OFC, I give them some tips and clues on what to get me. They reply that I need to give them more detailed information about what to get, since they don't want to get something for me that I won't like again, because that happened before, because they refuse to get me something I actually want. I reply, that they can just as well give me cash, since telling someone exactly what you want for Christmas ruins it. They say ok, they'll deal with it.  \n\n\nFast forward to Christmas eve. I'm German, here we celebrate @ the 24th after eating dinner. Everything was set up, and the exchange began. Keep in mind that for the first time since about 3-4 years, I couldn't get anyone anything since I didn't have a job. So we start, my sister gets her enormous backpack, her BF gets her a trip they can go on together (they love traveling together), my dog gets a couple of new toys and then me. I get a box which some could carry an umbrella or some sort of yoga Mat. My parents get their presents and I open mine up.   \n\n\nThey got me a dart Mat. Something you put under the dart board, so you know how far to stand away from it and it protects the ground. Only thing is, that this was completely unnecessary, since my parents knew that the rug in my room already was the oldest in the house and needed no protection and I already googled the recommended distance from the board and marked it with duct tape. So my parents basically got me something I absolutely had no need for.  \n\n\nOn top of that, it's worth about 10€ and my father even told me that he just stumbled upon it. So they weren't even searching.  \n\n\nI always try to give my giftees (if thats a word) something they wouldn't get themselves, thats like rule no.1 for gifting things, but they still like. My father is into cars for example and I got him a mug of a VW T1 that shows its insides if you warm it up.  \n\n\nI've been thinking about it and every time I try to bring it up with my parents my mother tries to make me feel guilty, saying things like \"another gift wasted\" or \"I knew you wouldn't like it\"  \n\n\nCan't seem to think anything other than my parents wanting to shove it in my face that I didn't want to give them specific directions on what to get me and wanted to punish me for it.  \n\n\nWhat do you think guys, AITA for being a spoiled brat?",

This leads to a lot of the students being impartial to the teacher since they are forced to be there, creating a sense of \"we don't like you and this class sucks\" for my teacher. Today before class started we saw a few other teachers give our teacher a giant teddy bear. I thought it was because it was my teacher's birthday because she didn't look sad and because I had no idea what else a giant teddy bear could mean. Class ends and its just me and a few of my friends straggling behind with me when I get the great idea to say \"What is the teddy bear for? Is it your birthday?\" while smiling like some kid who found a hundred dollars on the street. She pauses for a bit then says it's because her mother is **terminally ill** and she just found out recently. Well F\\*\\*\\*. No one really knows what to say and we all start leaving.

		"story": "Throwaway acc. Technically asking for a friend.\n\nI have a friend ('James') that is currently 20. He was active on tinder, and a girl that he met on there ('Emma') got pregnant. They practiced  safe sex- the pill &amp; condoms. James wants Emma to get an abortion,  and she says she isn't sure if she wants to do that. They had this massive argument over it. Details below, TLDR summary at bottom.\n\nJames is an international student, from a wealthy background. His tinder profile was pictures of him in sports cars and a pic of him in what is clearly a private jet seat. He has his own apartment and two luxury cars.\n\nWhen they were 'together', Emma would post snap/insta stories that showed the logos of the cars. She would also push him to bring the 'sports car' when they went out. After she discovered the value of the watches James wore, that too also became a fixture of her snap/IG.\n\nJames' grandparents are conservative Christians, as well as the source of the wealth in the family. James is the oldest grandson so he's expected to eventually take up the family business. This means that he's expected to marry someone from their 'class' and from the home country, preferably someone from a major business partner's family. There may be a racial aspect here too- while some of his relatives married spouses from other 'races', they were all from the same 'class', and weren't in line to inherit.\n\nIf James ends up fathering a child with a foreigner who doesn't benefit the 'family' he'll most likely end up not inheriting. He has a younger brother, two male cousins and a near-genius sister, so the grandparents have alternatives. Taking over the family business one day is very important to James- he's been groomed for it since he was born.\n\nJames doesn't think that his 'relationship' with Emma was anything more than FWB. He continued using tinder after meeting Emma, and his snap stories regularly showed him in close contact with other girls (never anything explicit, but 'close'). His insta account also doesn't have any mention of Emma.\n\nI'm personally involved in this because I told James to get tinder when we were on vacation, and because he's the closest thing I have to a brother. Dickish as his behavior may have been, I don't want him to get his future hurt by this. From a more selfish POV, James inheriting the family business is good for me since I know him far better than his brother/cousins.\n\nTLDR  \nJames thinks Emma is only considering keeping the baby because she knows he is from a wealthy family. Fathering a kid at 20 is not something James wants at all, and doing so out of wedlock and with someone from a foreign country will almost certainly lose him the inheritance/family business. James has also been seeing other women while 'with' Emma.  James wants Emma to have an abortion, Emma was hesitant, and they argued about it.\n\nAFAIK abortions are free where they are at, but James is completely okay with footing the bill.",

So you are looking at straight 7-8 months of chilled out life, with a job in hand and no study to do while others are freaking out for placements.\n\nSo here goes: Turns out in our induction that there is an opening in HR analytics(her project) while nothing is mentioned about my area (career management &amp; development). My first intuition is that I have to do well on my part, as well as to derail her to have a shot at the job offer. She doesn't know much about analytics, so that makes my job much simpler, because I can pitch in, talk to partners about her project details and implementation which she cannot do.\n\nI systematically push for being a part of her project too, because of the above mentioned agenda and also the pure interest in working on HR analytics, my somewhat favourite area in HR. I take her data, do my own progress, share nothing with her while she is handcuffed to come to me for help, because it is not her area of expertise. \n\nAfter the mid review, turns out that they are not very keen at looking at technicalities of the implementation and all, which has been somewhat of my focus till now. I get an epiphany that if I do a good job on this, she'll get all the credit(it is her project after all) because no one is bothered about the technical aspects. I tell my manager about it, clarifying clearly that I want something end-to-end(MBA jargon) and that I want out if there isn't anything of that kind.

This same situation happened about a year or two ago, and my sister cursed me out, called me every name in the book, all in front my neighbors. I ignored the fuck out of her bc I know how she gets and when she’s like that, it’s pointless talking to her. \n\nSo, today, I walked outside and I see my sister, niece, and grandmas walking over. And I instantly cringe bc I know my niece and sister are gonna want me to pick up my dog, and I’m not gonna want to, so it’s gonna be some bullshit. My sister is also pregnant again, so, moody ya know. I should also say, my dog is super small. A Jack Russell terrier. I was hoping if I ignored my niece wanting us to pick up my dog she’d be ok and shut up about it. She didn’t. My fiancé doesn’t wanna have to hear them complain about it, so she picks her up in the kennel to avoid the bullshit. I’m different. I don’t feel like I should have to pick up my damn dog in our own house. My fiancé agrees, but she doesn’t want drama. My grandmaw was holding my niece bc she knows how my niece is gonna get if she puts her down. The whole time, my niece is constantly demanding us to put up the dog. My fiancé puts the dog in the kennel, and I say not to. My sister makes some remark about I’ll be ok, to get over myself.

I said “just because you believe the world is one way, doesn’t mean it is.” They seemed really upset and it’s been bothering me for a while.  \n\nSo, I ask, \nAm I the asshole?\n\nEdit: for clarification, L had a very much “holier then thou” attitude about it. Basically trying to say they could be way better then any of us without going to university because they’re so smart and bright. And it was in fact a conversation where we were bouncing ideas off each other. \n\nEdit: alright, I accept my judgement. The way I phrased things was definitely not great, and while I never apologized, it blew over very very quick. It was on a Friday, I didn’t see L all weekend, they were completely fine when I saw them again. The only thing I’m salty about is people insulting me for saying you can’t become an engineer without some kind of degree. Engineering is something that requires a lot of specific skills and knowledge not taught in high school. Idk, if you’re an engineer without a university or college degree, leave a comment. \n\nEdit: I googled it and you legally cannot become an engineer without a degree where I live because of safety reasons",

My wife and are mid 30 professionals, together for 7 years with 2 kids, age 4 and 2.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, my wife has been getting more and more upset lately with the fact that after she goes to bed I like to load my vape and smoke some weed, often resulting in me falling asleep on the couch until I eventually wake up (usually around 4am) and crawl into bed.\n\nI smoked weed before we met and during the onset of our relationship, when I still had a lot of \"me time\".  Obviously as our lives started becoming less about us and more about our family, my weed smoking slowed.  Just recently though, weed became legal where I live and I got back into it, more frequently.\n\nWhen I began smoking more regularly, she let me know, that she has never been a huge fan of hanging out with me when I'm stoned.  I don't see a huge difference in my personality when I smoke, but it is obvious to her, so I agreed that I wouldn't smoke when we were together.\n\nMy wife has always been an early to bed type person (like 10:30ish), whereas I have always been a night owl (1ish).  So, lately I use that time when my wife goes to bed smoke my dope and reddit or watch youtube or movies or whatever.\n\nThe issue she says she has is that I often end up falling asleep on the couch and either she will wake up without me in bed and feel the need to come downstairs and wake me up to come to bed, or when I wake up on my own and come to bed, I'm disrupting her sleep.  My wife is a light sleeper, and in the past would use earplugs and a blindfold when sleeping to block out any possibly stimuli, but sine we had kids she doesn't use earplugs because... kids.\n\nI have tried coming to bed when she goes to bed, but I just lay there watching netflix at a volume that is barely audible until I fall asleep at my usual time, and it is miserable and makes me feel resentful.\n\nWe've talked about all of this and have come to an impasse.  I tried to explain to her that I enjoy the few late night hours that I have to myself to do the tings that I enjoy and I don't feel they have any significant impact on her.  She does not agree and feels that waking up in the middle of the night to \"bring me to bed\" or my coming to bed is a huge interference in her sleep.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA?

I say \"I was expecting to meet you by the door and it's busy so I didn't see you at first\". She keeps arguing. I say this is a date and I think we should be nice to each other, and if she disagrees we can leave. She says \"You being overly sensitive is not my problem\". I repeat that I'm going to leave if she doesn't want to be nice, and she keeps yelling so I start to get up. She throws her hands up and yells \"Really!?\". I walk out and my wife doesn't follow.\n\n----\n\nI'm not sure whether I did the right thing. I know it's rude of her to be so vocally critical and insulting, especially in front of other people.

This kid, let's call him Dan, struggled with the IT coursework and I think I'm right in saying (although I'm no doctor) that muscular dystrophy does not affect the brain, so he was just a bit plain old slow.\n\nBecause I was pretty good at IT and had a free period after the IT class, the teacher asked me to spare an hour after each class (twice a week) to help Dan with his coursework. Although I wasn't thrilled at the prospect of losing half my lunch break twice a week, I said yes because I felt bad for the kid and hoped this would give me some sort of extra credit from the teacher.\n\nThis went on for the rest of the year, maybe 4 or 5 months, until we broke up for the summer break. When we came back to school the next year, Dan wasn't there and everyone just assumed he had changed schools or dropped out for whatever reason.\n\nFast forward another couple of months and one day, during lunch period, the headmaster gathered everyone in our year group into the common room.

		"story": "Babe, if you see this, I love you. I feel like maybe we're both being a little stubborn here and I want a gut check. First time posting here.\n\nAlright, so, Will and I moved to my hometown area in April of last year and since the move he's gotten 3 speeding tickets. The first, last summer, on his way to work. The second, last month on our way home from work (we started working together in the fall). The third just tonight on our way into work. He usually drives us to and from work, our commute is ~45 minutes (mostly highway).\n\nWe've had numerous small fights as a result of me giving him driving advice, or in general things I've said in the car. I used to repeat \"we're going to be late, we're going to be late\" whenever we were, obviously, going to be late to work. He told me he didn't like that, I've since stopped. I was the asshole there.\n\nBut in the past he has also made me out to be the asshole for more reasonable things, like asking him to slow down sooner at stop signs/stoplights in the snow. I'm from this area, I've driven in the snow more, etc. He's gotten a little better about taking that type of advice, but now I usually opt to drive us whenever it's snowing. We've talked about how I don't like to be vilified for giving driving advice and he's since gotten better at taking my most of my advice. But not always.\n\nHis speeding ticket from last month was for going 63 mph in a 35 mph. We had just exited the highway and the ramp is a straight shot, downhill into a business area. The ramp is 2 lanes and can be difficult to slow down, most people coast in at around 50 and gradually slow further into the business area. There were 2 cops posted at a closed gas station, we were pulled over and while Will was being ticketed another car was pulled over, so IMO it was a speed trap. But still, Will could been going slower and was going faster than the general traffic. He was in the left lane passing a car in the right, so he was at the very least going faster than them.\n\nSince then he's started slowing down, a lot, whenever highway speeds change to business speeds. There is another, similar area where the speed changes from 65 to 35 on our route home. It's an even steeper hill and almost nobody slows down to 35 right off the bat. I've told him that he should not brake so hard here, and this is where he will not listen to me. I think it's dangerous and unnecessary to slow down and brake so much in an area where nobody else does. I've told him he should just coast down the hill and just make sure he's not going so fast on once we hit the businesses. He says he doesn't want to get another speeding ticket, what if there was a cop behind him, etc.\n\nHis third ticket, that he received tonight (we work 3rd shift), was for driving 82 on the highway in an area that is either 60 or 55 (the speed changes in that area, I can find out for sure if anyway really cares). He was passing another car, this time he was in the right lane and the car he was passing was in the left. He says he doesn't regret passing the car, since the road was going to merge into a single lane and he didn't want to get stuck behind a slow car. Whatever. I think he was going too fast. I don't know that I would have gone up to 82 to pass that car, but maybe that's personal bias.\n\nWe're both fast drivers, we both speed a decent amount and we could both benefit from doing it less. He drives us a significant amount more than I do. But I think he's overreacting. On parts of the remaining drive into work he was driving 52 in a 55... I suggested that he'll be fine driving 5-10 mph over on the highway, and it's reasonable that he's gotten speeding tickets for driving 20-30 mph over the speed limit. But somehow I'm The Asshole.\n\nWe're agreed that I'll drive us into work more often now, but I don't want to feel like the asshole for telling him he's overreacting and to drive faster in certain scenarios. Like, when it's unnecessary or we're going to be late. It might be worth noting that I am usually ready to leave before he is. We've made steps to wake up and get ready earlier, but slip up now and again. IMO his being ready 3-4 minutes later than me is usually why we are ~5 minutes late to work. Sometimes it's me, sure, but it's usually him.\n\nTL;DR My (25f) boyfriend (24m) has two recent tickets (one for 63 in a 35 the second for 82 in a 55). I think he should find the happy medium and drive 5-10 over the speed limit instead of 20-30 over. He doesn't really think the tickets were his fault. But he also thinks he needs to slow down to the speed limit immediately whenever the speed limit changes and has even started driving under the speed limit.

Over the years, I've made various items for friends and family members. It's rare for anyone in my life to come out and request or ask for something specific, but on the occasion they do, I'll take it into consideration and charge them appropriately for my time, skill level, and materials. In the past, I've had requests for things like skirts (easy peasy), and one of my friends comes to me for alterations on her clothing often.\n\nA few weeks ago, a friend of mine approached me with a request to make an Easter Sunday outfit for her two daughters. I politely declined, and gave her the contact information of a friend who delights in making things for children.\n\nMy friend pushed me on it a few times, and eventually I told her this in a message:\n\n&gt;I get why you want me to be the one to make it, and I'm flattered you think so highly of what I can do. It really means a lot to me. But I have to be honest with you: I've found that it's just not worth it for me to make things for children. It's a lot of time and effort to go through the whole process for an item they could only wear once, and especially since kids are not always careful with their clothing, it's easy for them to get ruined. They just grow too quickly for it to be worth it for me.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I know this may not make sense to you, but think if you'd put hours and hours of effort into a painting for someone only to find it viewed once or twice, and then placed in a room no one goes into. That's what it's like to make handcrafted items for little kids. If it's easier to understand, know that I would also decline making an ornate wedding gown as well.\n\nNow, I understand people are pretty sensitive about anything involving kids, and I tried to be as polite and tactful as I possibly could be. But it wasn't graceful enough, and my friend showed me that. She was polite in the response, but I found out quickly from mutual friends that she (on a filtered post or in a Mommy group or something) blasted me. From what I understand, a lot of the other people who responded to her agreed with her and a few of them went so far as to rip into items I've made (I have a clothing blog and a FB page) knocking on the quality, style, and even going so far as to rip into my looks. \n\nMy first thought?

I'm naturally a procrastinator. I was able to make it work, kinda. What happened is that I couldn't seriously study unless it was *the day of the test* (the exception being history, since I love history). My strategy was to waste time everyday on my phone, jerking off, playing clash of clans. Then I'd wake up really early on the test and study. At first this worked, and I aced the tests. Then the tests got more constant, and I began doing this almost everday. I got sleep deprived, my grades dropped. I was almost kicked out, but I convinced my history teacher to convince the school to give me a chance. This next part is probably stereotypical as hell, but I decided to change my life. I looked at how I was then- unproductive, skinny as hell, unpopular. I decided I had to change all that. I limited my jacking off to once every 2 weeks, joinrf the debate team, signed up with the rowing team, started looking up productivity tips, all that.

I’ve gotten pretty decent, but I’m still really insecure about my ability and I don’t like playing to people. My boyfriend has been begging me to play to him for a good while, but I’ve only done it a handful of times. He is really lovely every time, but I just don’t feel nice when I play for him. I’m trying to work on it.\n\nAnyways, a few days ago it was his birthday, so (among other gifts) I sent him a video of me playing his favourite song (Television/So Far So Good by Rex Orange County)  \n\nHe was over the moon when I sent it. He loved it, and kept sending me texts telling me how incredible it was. We met up for dinner, I gave him his other gifts, and he spent a good part of the meal raving about the video. We went back to his place for a while, then I went back home and went to sleep.\n\nIn the morning, I had messages from friends telling me I was a great drummer, and asking why I hadn’t performed or played for them yet. Confused and panicked, I opened Facebook to see my boyfriend had posted the video, and tagged me in it. I was mortified and immediately panicked and texted him telling him to call me.\n\nHe called, and I instantly started sobbing. I begged him to delete the post. After a few minutes of him telling me the video was awesome and I needed to share my talent with our friends, he reluctantly agreed to take it down. I thanked him and hung up to calm down. I was slightly mad, but more panicked. I understood why he did it but it was still careless, I felt. \n\nAbout half an hour later, he sent me a text, saying that I was being ridiculous and that I’d never told him he couldn’t post it, so how was he meant to know? And besides, it was a gift to him so surely he could do what he wanted with it. He said he’d spoke to our mutual friend, who had agreed I was being ridiculous.\n\nSo, Reddit, am I the asshole??\n\nTL;DR: Am a drummer who is insecure, sent my bf a video of me drumming for his birthday, he posted it on Facebook, knowing my insecurity. I panicked and got a little mad, he thinks I’m being ridiculous. \n\n\n\n\n",

And I’m 1.5 gen? Chinese American (moved to the states when I was in 5th grade), and he’s white, also the first non Asian guy I’ve dated. \n\nWe’ve been together for a little over a year, I was the first one to say I love you. I met his family over the winter holidays since they’re in the same state. And it went really well, his folks are super sweet and your typical laidback Californians. My parents are on the other side, both geographic location and general attitudes. \n\nChinese New Year is coming up, he asked me if I’d introduce him to my parents, they’re visiting and staying with me for a week (bf and I still live separately). I jokingly said not until he has a job, cuz right now my uber Chinese parents would not like the idea of me dating a younger non Chinese jobless dude. Apparently I definitely shouldn’t have said that, cuz it set him off, and he accused me of being ashamed of him and that he wasn’t good enough.  \n\nHe thinks I worry about what people think too much, especially my parents, which I admit I had been growing up but I think I’m much better about it now. It’s just I really like this guy and I want my parents to like him too! And I just don’t think that him not having a job right now (and yes my mom would totally ask him), on top of being white and younger would help. My parents can be very black and white and they would just see him as jobless instead of “inbetween”. They’re getting older too, so I wanna do my best to not upset them or make them worry (especially my mom). My lil sis just graduated med school and is engaged to a guy she met in school who’s also got a shiny asian-proved degree (I forgot what it was, didn’t really bother to remember to make myself feel even worse). Whereas I changed my career to the creative fields in my mid 20s cuz I wanted to pursue my passion, and my parents are still coming around to that. \n\nI just hate that we’ve been arguing over something that’s not even really a legit problem. Cuz he’ll obviously get another job, he’s very smart and hard working. But he thinks it’s about the principle. And I think he’s a white boy warrior who doesn’t understand my cultural background and is trying to save me from being in this mental prison of caring too much. He did say that he’d lie and tell my parents that he has a job, which was nice of him, but I feel like he was just trying to make me feel better cuz we’d been arguing over the past week. I got upset over how this was even a thing we argued about in the first place. Especially when I was gonna introduce him to my parents regardless if he was gonna have a job by next week, and when asked to tell a simple white lie, he could’ve just said, oh yeah I don’t quite get it but I’d tell an innocent white lie for you. Apparently he also thinks that I’m ashamed to bring him around my asian friends, and I told him they’re all in their 30s now, married having kids or about to, we don’t get to hang out as much as you and your early 20s friends. But he didn’t buy that. I mean I do jokingly complain about not being as successful in all the areas in my life as my friends, but I thought he knew that I was mostly joking and being self deprecating! I fell in love with him so quickly in huge part because he got my sense of humor (which can be super crass and something all my exes just tolerated, but this guy loves)! This meeting my parents thing definitely opened up a can of worms which I didn’t even realize existed.\n\nNow I’m super stressed out over my parents’ visit. I don’t wanna upset them or my boyfriend. I know he will lie for me but I’m also gonna feel really bad for him now, because apparently this hurt him quite a bit. And I also wasn’t aware that he’d been feeling like I was ashamed of him for a while now. \n\nTl;dr My white boyfriend thinks I’m ashamed of him for not letting him meet my super traditional Chinese parents till he’s got a job, and he also thinks I’m ashamed to bring him around my asian friends. \n\nNote: I posted this in another sub as well, and people have mentioned that I’m a grown up, I should act like one. But I think part of being a grown up also means you should take in your aging parents feelings into consideration? And me and my boyfriend as younger folks could compromise a bit more?

I'd made friends with everyone in the office including one of the girls in the office I'll call her Sarah. We became quite good friends chatting about things, we worked late together a lot of the time and talked life and relationships, she had a boyfriend of 3 years. I'm 26 she's 22, so we'd just swap stories and had fun. She would complain to me about her problems with her boyfriend and I'd give advice on how to handle things. \n\nAbout a year into this job my gf and I split just before Christmas. I was feeling like shit and drinking very heavily showed up to work still plastered and we just talked all day (it was the holidays so we were basically alone in the office). I agreed to go out for a few drinks with her and her friends met her sister and friendship group even got one of her friend's numbers, let's call her Liz. \n\nWe met a few times for drinks just the two of us and I'd tell her stupid stories then we'd meet friends and go out. I met her boyfriend a few times in this period he was alright just a bit of an arse, he'd ignore her when they were out, chat to girls, nothing too bad and not overly flirty but it upset Sarah. \n\nThis is where it goes off the deep end a bit we started texting pretty much every day it was all harmless at first a lot of innocent questions, but eventually led to us talking a lot about sex, what we each liked etc. I felt uncomfortable and tried to guide the conversation towards more innocent topics, but she kept coming back to it, it spilled into work as well a few emails for the sfw stuff. \n\nShe then got a new job and the office all went out for a night out for her leaving do, I was going away the next day, so I agreed to a few drinks and then heading home. We met with Liz and a couple more of Sarah's mates on the night, I'd gone on a date with Liz and it hadn't gone brilliantly but we were still friendly and the spark was building up again, I was thinking of asking her out. Sarah saw this and basically spent the night draped over me, now I'd had a thing for her since I'd started working there and it was only a couple of months on from the break up so I felt really good getting some attention. We started talking and both admitted we had feelings for each other, but also acknowledged because of her bf we would leave it especially as I was going away. \n\nI went away and the texting continued, at which point she said she was going to leave her bf. I was talking to a friend on the second night, and she told me I was an arse for destabilising Sarah's relationship. I'd thought this for a while and sent her a message saying we should stop talking until she's sorted her head out, she said she wanted to carry on talking and so we did. I'm not proud of that. I got back and she came round and told me they broke up after I sent that text. We slept together that night, then on and off for a month after. I went away again and she broke things off and tried to get back with her bf, which didn't work out at all. I found out that she'd actually left him the day before i got back. \n\nI occasionally speak to Sarah now we've met once or twice and made plans to do other stuff, bit we're both quite busy and to be honest the whole thing has kind of knocked my perception of myself, so I don't really fancy speaking to her because it drudges up bad memories. \n\nAITA here?\n\nTldr; broke up a relationship even when I knew the girl had problems with her boyfriend ",

We're only 3 months away from our wedding and it can't come soon enough.\n\nWe obviously fight, but have been on the same page and good at compromising with each other. This issue has come up recently, though, and we're both very stubborn with how we feel.\n\nSomething I've always dealt with is an awkward last name. It's unusual and hard to spell and that's just something everyone in my family has gotten used to. As a kid, I hated having an unusual last name, but have since come to embrace and really like it. That said, her name happens to start with the same letter as my last name and sounds awkward together. I have no problem that she wants to keep her name because I'd probably do the same in her situation. I also wouldn't name my kid something w/ this same letter because of the same reason so I get that.\n\nMy problem stems from the next step she's taken in saying that she wants her kids to have the same last name as her. She suggests we either hyphenate our names or  add an initial of her last name in front of mine for our kids. These aren't are initials, but for example, if my name was John Smith and her name was Sally Johnson, she'd want our kids names to be either '[First Name] [Middle Name] Johnson-Smith' or '[First Name] [Middle Name] J. Smith'. Admittedly, those options sound better than what our names would actually be.\n\nShe thinks I'm being unfair because I don't want t compromise. She's saying she wants one thing and I want another and she is offering a solution in the middle that should appease both of us. From my perspective, I've grown up knowing (believing I guess) that my kids would have my last name, the same as their grandpa, etc.\n\nNow, I imagine she's coming to this conclusion because we've had a solid history of compromising. In this scenario, however, I've been stubborn because I don't want to compromise at all. If the two options are a) my last name as is, or b) anything else, I'm going to choose a.\n\nI accept I may be the asshole here, but would love to hear the thoughts of the group and the discussion that may follow.\n\n",

The step kids have a dysfunctional relationship with their mother &amp; grandparents (who they live with), and a long distance relationship with their father &amp; stepmom who live in a different state. FH loved and helped raise these kids as his own during his marriage, until his ex racked up a huge amount of debt (20k+) and cheated on him with multiple guys. \n\nDespite having no custody agreement or rights, FH wanted to keep a relationship with his former stepkids. The stepkids didn’t seem interested. His ex was all game as she used the kids as leverage to get extra money, school supplies and the like out of him and she got every weekend to herself to party. \n\nAbout a year after the divorce I met and started dating FH.

FH they seem to view as an ATM- ignore it until you want money/stuff. \n\nFH has told me before that he views these kids (currently 18 &amp; 16 yrs old) as “his kids” but understands that he has no right to their lives or a part in it. As their behavior has gotten worse, he has scaled back more and more on contact. As is, they ignore him entirely on all fronts unless they think there is something to gain in it (ie expensive tech,money,etc). I told FH that I understand if he wants to keep contact for sentimentality’s sake, but I do not have any interest in this point in a relationship with them and don’t want them around LO period.

I immediately became super grossed out by it and refused to sleep on another woman's, let alone his ex's, period blood stain.\n\nHe changed the sheets, but wanted to keep the sheets because they're perfectly good sheets but have stains.

I spend so much of time nauseous and dizzy it’s ridiculous. I am running myself ragged to weekly drs appts. I’m so tired. \n\nNow my bf likes to have sex a lot and this has become an issue since we literally have went from sex on a daily basis to every 2-3 days. Today has been 5 days and he asked me can we have sex if I was feeling up to it and I said maybe. I told him essentially I don’t feel like I’m having a bad or good day today and that I would be down to at least cuddle and watch tv at the least. I had already explained that I was tired and had gotten minimal sleep last night. I have my son every other week and I had him all day by myself today which is in and of itself exhausting because he’s 2 and busy af. \n\nMy bf has taken on a lot with the household and with helping take care of my son. He basically takes care of me and my kid right now but he even helps me shower because it’s hard for me to do on my own with the midline in. He works for the DOD and he’s 2 weeks away from being affected by this government shut down. I understand his frustrations and am always an ear to talk to plus this affects our household. He complains about needing to relax and how sex helps him with that. I tell him to go to the gym or get a hobby. \n\nBasically the things that he did and pissed me off was I had told him to ask me to have sex once and let it be that. He had a habit of asking several times or asking me how I felt with the sole intention of getting laid. Which he knows he’s an asshole for. Today he asked me if I was feeling up to it and I said not really. He then later on the evening while we were the kitchen came behind me and tried to pull my pants down.

The thing you have to understand about my aunt is that she is very 'woke'. She posts super 'deep' things on facebook all day that basically are all just variations of 'phone bad, book good', 'depression is a choice' and 'selfies make you a bad person'.  A lot of these ideals run pretty deep in my family and because of that I was not diagnosed with Depression, Anxiety and obsessive compulsive disorder until I was a teenager and demanded help. Needless to say it is a sore spot.\n\nSince then my aunt does not really talk to me in a nice way. Every once in a blue moon she will tag me in some sparkly facebook meme about how 'family is forever'. That is the extent of our nice relationship. More commonly she tags me a lot in pretty offensive memes. Lots are different variations of 'depression isn't real medicine is evil just go for a walk in the woods'. She also tags me a lot in memes where people are on their tech and missing out on life because she knows my passion is computers. Since coming out I have even gotten a few 'If we turn our backs on God he will turn his back on us' memes. I try to ignore it because besides tagging me in the stuff she isn't really that aggressive about it.\n\nWell this morning I woke up and when I checked my Kindle the first thing I saw was a picture she tagged me in. It was a Jesus saves meme.  I mean it would have been whatever but she also typed a bunch. To paraphrase she basically said that my cousin (Her daughter) was really particular about stuff and anxious too but that she got over it and I could too. She said that if I learned to let love in my heart and let her be my aunt (Referring to the fact that I constantly forget to call her aunt) she could help me. She offered to take walks with me because 'it will fix me right up' and told me I could 'find my way back' and be 'a good person again'. Keep in mind I have never done anything wrong to this woman.\n\nI lost it a bit and texted a very long message to her where I pointed out that she thinks social media is evil but only ever bothers to contact me via memes on facebook. I asked why she always posts about how evil being online is and how good books are when she told my mom to beat my butt when I was a kid for reading Harry Potter. I told her that I could not just stop taking my meds and that walking off mental illness was impossible. I told her that with family like mine I didn't need enemies and that she had to stop comparing me to her perfect daughter. I told her off for tagging me and saying stuff like that publicly.  I said I always forgot to call her aunt because she only ever contacts me once in a blue moon to be mean to me so I don't think of her that way. I told her that I didn't care what she thought about me because she never showed me enough love to be important to me.Then I rounded it out saying that she needs to lay of on me being gay because 'If it was not for Alan Turing a gay man you would not be able to bug me about any of this online'.\n\nI didn't cuss or call names(outside of calling her a judgmental hypocrite and mean). It took me over an hour to type (It was a bit more elegant than what I posted above). I was blocked on social media right away and she messaged back that I never need to speak to her again. Her children all messaged me within the hour calling me some pretty nasty names.  I got a few messaged from uncles, cousins that all blocked me. My friend who is on her social media told me she posted screen shots on facebook and made a bit to do about how I never talk to anyone and am 'always alone' and she understand why now.\n\nOn one hand I feel like she is the asshole for always being so mean and judgmental when I have only ever tried to be nice. On the other I feel like I am the asshole for basically accusing her of never loving me.

It sucks to have to go home because you forgot your way to pay for something. And for just one donut, it's probably both frustrating and embarrassing.

As time has gone on things have gotten more habitual, obviously. I’ve spent the past 6mos to 1yr trying to get him to understand that the things he does hurt my feelings. He’s not super emotionally intelligent, so I’m not surprised that he hasn’t gotten the message yet. \n\nBackstory -\n\n6 months ago he lost his temper when I woke him up for work one morning and broke something from our wedding that was really important to me. I was done. Ready to pack and leave that day. He convinced me to stay, go to work with him and build some shelving that I had been wanting for the house and we’d hang them together, and work on our relationship and he’d work on his temper. \n\nTo his credit, he’s really been a lot better with his temper. I’m really proud of him for that. But the shelves have been sitting. Well half of them, I hung half by myself but the others are too big for me to do by myself. I tried and they fell. \n\nSo they’ve been sitting, along with our relationship. Every time I look at them I get a little more sad. Every time I mention them he doesn’t react much, but I get the impression he just wants them to go away. \n\nOur friend is now my best friend, but they knew each other first. She and her husband started moving this past weekend into their new home. We offered to go up and help them. Sunday night he brought me home and went back. On our way home, I can’t remember what started the conversation but I asked him if he understood why his willingness to go back and help them (or anyone for that matter) at a drop of a hat, but not take the time to do things around the house when I need help would make me feel upset and hurt. He said yes and asked what else besides the shelves I meant. I was surprised that he said yes so I couldn’t even respond. It felt as though he was purposefully blowing me off because I didn’t mention the shelves specifically, but they were definitely on my mind at the time. \n\n\n",

Well yesterday we had one of those arguments and it put both of us in a bad mood. We end up making up, we have dinner together, watch TV everything seems fine. So we go to bed. Usually I initiate sex but tonight she does. Our usual routine with sex is foreplay and such, until she cums, then we start having sex. Well no matter what I did she couldn’t cum and this probably went on for 20 to 30 min. So she gets annoyed and says “I’m not going to cum, I’m going to bed goodnight” and rolls over. She says it with kind of an attitude. Now she’s extremely wet, and up until this point everything was pointing in the direction of sex. So I’m like what the fuck and I say “are you serious, are you really going to tease me and then just go to bed”. So I roll over and a minute or two passes by and then she rolls back over initiates again. And we start having sex. And I ask “is this pitty sex?” She says “yes”. So I said “fuck this” stop having sex and go take a shower. When I get back we have a little argument she calls me an “asshole” I say “I’m not having fucking pitty sex”, we end up going to bed. This morning we apologize to each other. I still wanna talk about it when we both get home from work but I’m still confused about the whole situation\n\nI feel like she could’ve easily still been into it, or could have cum later during sex and that her abruptly turning over and giving me attitude because I couldn’t make her cum is kind of a dick move. I also think she got in her own head, because I can almost always make her cum and that it wasn’t my fault to begin with.

She basically leaves at 7 and returns at 4, and I'm so much attached to her that I basically spend all my day waiting for her to return. It's been a couple of days she's returning home late, at 6 mostly. Like always she texts me that she's back home, but these few days she says she's tired and that's it. She doesn't text me at all for a few hours and just texts me back at night as if nothing's happened. I don't know if I'm overreacting, but I don't get why she doesn't even text me saying that she'll get some sleep and then text me after waking up. She wakes up, does her shopping for dinner, goes to her friend comes back and then texts me saying what I have been up to. So today I've had enough so I said i was sad and mad that she didn't text me saying she'd sleep and didn't text me after waking up. I said that I'd text her tomorrow because I was not in a good mood today. I'd be happy to hear her out tomorrow and accept it if I was overreacting and maybe she was really tired and i would be the asshole then for not seeing it through her perspective. But she kept on spamming me hearts and kiss emojis, which to me was very annoying. I proceeded to tell her that her way of approaching and handling this situation was making it worse and we should just call it a day and go to sleep. She kept texting me saying why I had to be mad about small things like these, she also said that atleast she texted back despite the fact it being late. I didn't want to ignore her, but I was pretty much very annoyed so I still calmly said you're just forcing me to talk and its making it worse to which she replied that she didn't know how trying to handle the situation is making it worse and asked why I was thinking like that. \"I don't have anybody else except for you to talk to\", that's what she said. So I said \"bro\" and was typing out my message that this isn't okay at all but she quickly replied with \"yes sis\" which might would've been her attempt at trying to be funny but I honestly had enough. All i asked for was time and space which isn't even much as I said I'd text her back in the morning and it was 9 here already. She said \"Go on then, text me back when you're mood is good. What can I do? Me speaking seems to only make the situation worse and annoy you.\" She said this in our language with much respect so this was very sarcastic and this is only a rough translation. I was pretty annoyed. I said you don't have to say that as a reply to her \"take rest\". So she started to rant again \"Who am I to you anyways.. and blah blah blah\", so I just blocked her for now.\n\nI will text her back in the morning but I don't know if what i did was a good approach to this situation.

She feeds and shelters them, but emotionally neglects them to the point where one cat ran away and lives with a neighbor across the street now, and her other cat basically moved in with us, but goes home for the odd feeding. Husband and I are big cat people, so we always showed affection to their cat when it came over and thus, the unofficial adoption. To be honest, her cat is kinda annoying and our cat isn't a fan, and I wish he didn't like us so much, but what can you do. \n\nAnyway, about 6 months ago I noticed her cat loosing weight, despite eating a ton of food at our house and at her house. Deduced it was diabetes. Mentioned to her he was skinny, kept hinting he should see a vet, even weighed him and proved he was loosing weight and still she dragged her feet about taking him to the vet. \n\nNow they don't make a lot of money, but enough for a vet, and plus don't own pets if you can't take care of them. Anyway she is aggressively cheap and I just knew it was about money so I offered to pay half if she took him to the vet. She immediately agrees, makes an appt, takes him to the vet, they run a bunch of tests and treat him for a few things, to the tune of $400. I pay my half as promised, with no expectations that she would pay me back. It was a straight up gift on my part.\n\nFast forward a few months and her cat is doing much better. Weight is back on and then some. Still spends 90% of it's time chilling at our house. I mean, he sleeps in our bed. \n\nHere is where I am thinking of potentially entering asshole territory: her grandma died over the summer, shortly after the vet trip, and she just now received an unexpected inheritance of around $30k. I would never expect her to pay me back normally, but now that she has this big windfall, would I be a jerk if I asked her to kick me back the money I paid for her cat? \n\nSorry I lied at the beginning and said this would be short and sweet.

		"story": "Context -So I had a uni friend (let's call her Ani) and we were friends from the very first year. We clicked and totally hit it off. She was very nice, very sweet (Italian) and she was always friendly. We would constantly go out to pubs (this is happening in London), restaurants and out as a group for coffee. We were happy and close.\n\nSo this story happens in our final year about a month ago from this posting. The final year is a big year because we have our dissertations to do. During the summer we were allocated a supervisor and chose topics. Ani got a notoriously lazy and slow replying supervisor from whom she couldn't get a reply from. So she messaged another lecturer (Jane, who taught both of us last year) and asked her of she knows if her supervisor was alive. Jane replied that Ani should just chill out and relax and stop disturbing the supervisor till after summer. Ani was annoyed a lot by this and told me this story. \n\nFast forwarding to December - I was in our uni library on the ground floor researching some stuff and I got a text from Ani. We messaged and turns out she was on the second floor. I told her I'd meet up in 10 minutes. This is where I thought of doing the prank. \n\nI yped in Google - disguise my email and came to a website that could send pretend emails to people as if from another person. So I sent an email as if from Jane (the teacher that pussed Ani off) to Ani with this text:\n\n'Dear Ani, I thought long and hard about out conversation last summer. I spoke with your supervisor and as a sorry here is a document with some research materials and links you might find useful.'\nAttached was a word doc\nIn the document was a meme saying - you've been pranked LOL.\n\nSo I sent that off and then as a test I sent the same email to myself instead of Ani using the same website. The email was sent to junk and was blocked with the labels saying it was dangerous and malicious and that you had to give specific permission to open it. So I thought to myself that there is no point of telling Ani about the prank (which I had the full intention of doing because I was meeting her in 10 minutes) since the email was so blocked she wouldn't open it. \n\nThis. Is. Where. I. Ducked. Up\n\nA week later I forgot about the incident. Ani didn't say anything either so I thought she never got it. Because if I got an email like that my first reaction would be to message the group chat and say - 'lmao which one of you shi* heads sent this?'. A week later I get an email from the head of department saying that she needs to interview me about 'impersonation of a teacher and harassment of a student'. My heart collapsed.\n\nI message Ani out of panic and tell her the truth and apologise. I take it all on the chin. She tells me she was deeply hurt and traumatised and how I have no respect for her. I told her that's not true. We've been friends for so long. She tells me that she told the ENTIRE department about this and she was having another meeting with other lecturers. I told her:\n\n-I'll take any punishment that comes to me even if it is suspension\n\nAni- suspension? You're going to get expelled.\n\nAt this point I was shaking. In England you pay for uni but you do get loans to help. I am not an British citizen. So I pay double without the loan that my parents pay and they struggle to. I work part time to help out too. To have all of that swept away in one go was terrifying. That night I seriously thought of ending i because of the shame I brought to myself and my parents. Then I decided to write a defence for myself and prepared for the interview. \n\nWhen I came to the interview the head of the department was very formal and just asked for my side. I was very apologetic, telling her that :\nI did not intend to be malicious\nI had the full intention of telling her if my test email sent through.\nI had no vendetta against her or Jane.\nAni and I were best friends.\nIf I thought that what I was doing was so wrong and I had the intention of doing it anonymously to I wouldn't have been stupid enough to do it on the uni system in the uni library.\n\n(I'll post the resolution email from the head to me at the end if you want to read)\n\nThe head looked at the email, briefly smiled when she saw the meme and told me to wait for the judgment. A week later I was told that the case was dismissed and everything was fine and just not to repeat this again. Also the head told me that Ani asked her to tell me never to contact her again or come near her. Prior to this she had blocked me on all social media.\n\nSo am I the asshole here? Or was the joke taken too far? \n\nTL;DR - made a prank email disguised from a lecturer to a friend with a meme inside. She took it personally and tried to get me expelled. \n\nThe resolution email from the head of department to me -\n\nDear Mark,\n\n\nThank you for coming to speak to me and H on Thursday and for giving us your account of the incident described in my last email. I’ve now had a chance to speak to the student who received the spoof email, and I’m writing to let you know that on behalf of the department, I have decided that no further action needs to be taken. This is because this is your first violation of King’s IT policy, and the incident does not appear to be part of a pattern of harassment of other King’s students or staff. I have let IT know the outcome of this investigation, and asked them to unblock your KCL account by the end of the day today.\n\n\nI include here a brief summary of our discussion, for the record and so that D is aware of the details. Please let me know if you would like to make any amendments to this account.\n\n\nWhen we met, you admitted immediately that you had sent the spoof email. You said that you and the student who received the email were friends, and that you sent the email as a joke from a library computer right before you were due to meet up with her, expecting that you would have a chance to explain the joke right away. You said that you had sent her other joke messages in the past, although not through King’s email. You said that you had not previously sent spoof emails, and that you found instructions for doing so online before sending this email. When you sent yourself a test email, you realized that the email you sent to her had been quarantined, so you assumed that she would not see it; it was only when you spoke to her later after she had released the email that you realized the seriousness of what you had done. You said that you knew about the student’s earlier correspondence with J about her dissertation because the student had told you about it herself at the time. \n\n\nIn our meeting, you expressed remorse for sending the email, and said that you understood the gravity of the offence and would not repeat it. You said that you are not currently experiencing difficulties that are interfering with your studies or your wellbeing, apart from the ongoing responsibility of caring for your younger siblings.\n\n\nAs we discussed at the meeting, any further violations of King’s policy (IT or otherwise) will be treated as a second offence, and may jeopardize your degree. This incident has been logged with the Student Conduct office in case this happens, although if there are no further violations, this incident will not appear on your King’s record. I would add from my conversation with the student who received the email that she has been distressed by this incident, and would like you to refrain from contacting her. I ask you to please respect her wishes.\n\n\nThank you again for your cooperation with this investigation. I wish you the best for the remainder of your degree, and I encourage you to speak to D as your personal tutor if you find that you are encountering any difficulties at any point.\n\n\nBest wishes,\n\nA)\n",

I don’t really mind this/brush it off since I won’t waste negative energy on someone who likely believes they’re just being nice.\n\nFast forward a few months; I’m a smoker and was outside the store and along the street for a cigarette break. This regular customer notices me and comes over to chat. I’m a little annoyed since I more or less want some peace while I smoke but I chat any way. As he was about to leave, he asks for a kiss and proceeds to lean in for one; I immediately pull away and shout ‘no’ before even thinking. He laughs and leaves.\n\nNow, for context I’m bisexual with a preference for women, so during his advances have told him I’m a lesbian in panic in an attempt for him to leave me alone, which I now see as wrong and has only made him pursue harder.\n\nSo my question is, I’ve grown sick and tired of being made to feel uncomfortable by his advances, after repeatedly trying to politely reject him to no avail. Would I be an asshole if I confronted him in a colder manner? Is he just so oblivious to my rejections? I feel like squashing this behaviour in a softer nicer way isn’t working for me but I also don’t want to step out of bounds in my work place and face major consequences if he decides to be the asshole and complain. \n\nMy boss and I get on really well, and I fully believe they’ll have my back on this, but I’m unsure what upper management would do in this scenario.",

		"story": "Not exactly sure what subreddit this goes in. But My girlfriend (20F) and I (19M) have been together for a year and a half now. She lives with her parents still and I share an apartment with 2 other guys. Her parents are extremely conservative and I think are just making her feel guilty anytime she is at the house with them. I don’t believe it’s directed at her but her mom has said before to her “don’t get pregnant it will change your life” and so she will feel guilty just because she and I aren’t conservative and are definitely liberal at our core. Basically because of her upbringing and her background she thinks that sex is super scary and that she will get pregnant immediately if I never wear a condom. So that’s fine I wrap it up. I spend the night occasionally at hers and she’ll sometimes come hangout at mine. Never spending the night of course because that’d be the end of the world for her parents.  She claims to enjoy sex and so once a month I’ll get to have sex with my girlfriend. Mind you I have to pull out while I wear a condom that is coated in spermicide. She’s an athlete like me though and extremely skinny so it’s not uncommon for their period cycles to be out of wack. Some months we have more sex others we have less. She’ll blow me here and there and give a handjob despite me telling her I don’t like them. But every month the week before she gets her period she’ll say that she’s late (23 day cycle is normal for her) and that she’s worried about being pregnant. How could she possibly be worried if we are only having sex once in a given month? and when we do have sex, I pull out with a condom on right before I finish or I won’t even finish via having vaginal sex at all because we don’t have it enough for me to be able to have sex with her at a pace that I can finish at... (basically got mad at me last time because she climaxed and I hadn’t yet and it was painful for her. Gee I wonder why) I try and tell her there’s no possible way she could be, she goes onto say that I’ll never understand because it’s not my body and that I’m not the one that could have a human growing inside of them....\n\nMore background, she and both of her siblings all went to catholic school and her sister(23) recently got married to her high school sweetheart. Another relationship that would shame her about sex and sex before marriage. They supposedly abstained up until marriage. That’s something she had used to say but said I had changed her mind about that. And also had told me that beginning of our relationship last year she’d be able to spend the night with me more as our relationship progressed. She even brought up that her sister is moving out next year and she may move in with them. \n\nWe definitely had a lot more sex last year but I’ve gotten a promotion and she didn’t so she’s trying to focus more. And she also had girlfriends’ houses last year she said she was spending the night at but has since distanced herself. So her parents are a lot more protective this year than last and it’s impacting our sex life. \nShe claims to enjoy sex and sometimes she’ll be the one to initiate it. Only when I’m not talking to her about it and basically when I forget about it completely. \n\nSo I guess what Im just going to start doing is trying not to even think about sex with my girlfriend at all and never be the one to initiate it. Because it winds up just blowing up in my face when I do. It’s not fair to me but I’m hoping to marry this girl eventually and hope that she’ll sexually blossom in the years to come. But right now she’s driving me insane with constantly worrying and it’s making me just want to distance myself from that aspect of our relationship. \n\nTL:DR girlfriend has vaginal sex with me once a month where I have to pull out with a condom on. Complains that she may be pregnant every month. ",

Despite this we realized we are completely right as friends. We still hang out regularly because we have similar hobbies and humor and have mutual friend groups. I have been dating my current boyfriend for four months now and it’s great. We’re nothing similar like me and my ex, but we connect on greater level where we aren’t fighting all the time like I was with my ex. It’s a much better relationship. Because my ex and I are so close, he and my bf have hung out a couple times with me and others. Both times it seemed fine and they actually got along well.\n\nHere’s the problem: In March a few of my friends are going to Maine to go hiking and see a friend couple who recently moved. My ex is among these friends going. I mentioned it to my bf and he wants to come and...I don’t want him to lol. First he doesn’t even know those friends and two, these are my friends. I want to be alone with them. He just came from some game convention thing with his friends that I didn’t even ask to go to (for one thing, idc about games) I know people need time with their friends. I told my bf I didn’t think that was a good idea and he said he didn’t see the problem since two people who are coming are in a relationship. However, they were already in the friend group and not a couple when I first met them and they’re the only couple besides the one in Maine. He got upset and said he only wanted to share an activity with me and feels bad that I’m more okay with spending time with my ex than I am with him and that I act very cliquey. However, I only spend time with my ex because we’re friends. If I hated everything about him, obviously I would not want to hang out with him.

Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n——————————————————————\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary.

Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me.

Also I'm on the mobile app and apparently that fucks with formatting, so apologies if this post looks a little bit wonky. Sorry if this gets long but y'all are gonna need a bit of backstory for context and I have a real issue with rambling. \n\nI met my now ex-girlfriend at school when we were 14. We were best friends for a year before we began dating and then were together for about six years. I'm 22 now and we've been broken up for a little over six months. I find it easier to tell a story with names so we'll call my ex Jessica. \n\nThe year that we were friends was great. We were both kind of \"emo kids\" and, being that we lived kind of in the middle of nowhere and there weren't any other emos at our school, we kinda naturally drifted towards each other. She was a kind, sweet girl at first - very bubbly, always smiling, always friendly to everybody. She could be a little hyperactive at times, but I'm incredibly laid back and  a bit shy so we kinda  balanced each other's energy perfectly. We'd hang out at each other's houses almost every night after school and play video games, or go walk around the local park if the weather was nicer. I awkwardly asked her out on Valentine's Day of 2012, thinking I was being dead romantic. Still one of the biggest mistakes of my life. \n\nShe started to change pretty soon after we started dating. She'd always been semi-jealous when it came to me, even when we were just friends. Think, if anyone else called me their best friend she'd get on their arse like \"actually sweetie he's *MY* best friend but nice try :)\" or she'd sulk a little if I made plans with other friends and didn't invite her. I'd always found it endearing, I guess because I was never the one getting chewed out. Boy did that change when we started dating! If I so much as spoke to another girl to ask her for the homework for some class, Jessica would get angry with me and demand to know who she was and what we were talking about. I did confront her about it a couple months into the relationship and she cried and told me she was super scared of being cheated on because she'd seen her dad do it to her mum her whole life and said she was sorry. At the time I thought that was reasonable, said alright and tried to move past it. \n\nThe jealousy didn't stop. In fact, it only continued to escalate. When we were 16 she, without my knowing or my consent, went through my Facebook friends and Instagram followers and blocked any girls I wasn't related to. When we were 18 we started renting a flat together and she threatened one of our neighbours to \"keep the fuck away from me\" because she brought over cookies as a welcome gift while Jessica was out. That same year when I came out as bisexual, she told me that she didn't want me hanging out with my best friend since childhood because he was gay and she was afraid of any \"funny business\" going on. It reached a point where she wouldn't even let me go to the hairdresser's because the only one in our town had three women and a gay guy working there and she didn't want any of them touching me. She also repeatedly called my workplace saying I needed to come home because there was an emergency if she knew I was on a shift with all female co-workers (which was often) resulting in me eventually being sacked. \n\nHonestly, if it was just the intense jealousy, I might have been able to cope, or try to salvage some semblance of a relationship with her. But she would also insult me constantly. I'm pretty prone to eczema and she'd make fun of me if I had a breakout of it on my face. She mocked me when I lost my job and she became the breadwinner of the house. She'd either tease me or get incredibly angry with me if I ever cried about anything (I'm a sucker for crying at films). I gained a little weight around 19 when I had an injury and could no longer go to the gym and she called me fat relentlessly (in hindsight, I really wasn't fat at all), which I believe was one of the catalysts to me developing bulimia. All in all it was a shitty, emotionally abusive situation and I should've gotten out of it sooner than I did. \n\nI eventually broke it off because she started to become physically and sexually violent and I was genuinely afraid for my life one night. I'm now staying with my aforementioned childhood best friend and his husband, have a new job, am in recovery for my eating disorder and am well on the way to getting back on my feet. To be clear, I'm not asking if I'm the asshole because of what happened in the relationship because I've come to accept that I was a victim and none of it was my fault. \n\nHowever. A \"friend of Jessica's\" recently reached out to me to let me know that Jess has been diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder and is recieving treatment for it. My response was basically \"ah that sucks for her and I'm glad she's getting treatment but what's that to do with me?\"  What eventually transpired was that I was not speaking to her friend, but in fact Jessica herself through her friend's account, and that I was expected to forgive everything she did because of her diagnosis. I flat out refused because, while I'm no means an expert on personality disorders and do understand that they can make people act irrationally, I don't believe they're an excuse for outright abusive behaviours. Since I refused to forgive her, I've had countless messages from her, from mutual friends, and even from her mother which all essentially boil down to \"she can't help being an abusive person, you're being awful for not forgiving her.\" I'll note here she hasn't actually *apologised*, just incessantly asked me to \"forgive and forget\", \"get over it\" and even to give her a second chance. I'm starting to doubt that I'm doing the right thing by refusing to accept her BPD as an excuse. AITA and should I forgive her? \n\nTL;DR: my ex was incredibly abusive when we were together and has since been diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder, which she's using to try and justify her behaviours without actually apologising. I refuse to accept it as an excuse and she, her mother and our mutual friends are telling me I'm the asshole for not forgiving her. \n",

One of the girls I met was 35 and wanted to come over to my place at night after a very minimal amount of chatting. I figured it was a classic bootycall. She came over, we had a good time, had drinks, and as expected she stayed the night. And that's where my fuck-up happend: I don't want to blame the excessive amount of alcohol (I'm pretty good at handeling my drink, but drank over 6 beers before she even came over, drank a lot more with her) but for some reason I was a fucking idiot and didn't use protection. \n\nThe next morning I realized this was a major fuck-up and went out to get us breakfast and got her a morning-after pill. She took it, we had breakfast, she told me she didn't have any STD's (which I wasn't so sure about given how easily she slept with me) and she left. (It later turned out she didn't give me any STD's btw).\n\nI ended up seeing her 4 more times in the next two weeks (I made sure to use condoms every time) - we always met at night, and I was very clear about not wanting a relationship - she said she didn't either. After those two weeks I kind of got my life together a bit more and wanted to quit casual hookups to go after this other girl that I was really in love with. So I broke up with her - and she took it HARD. Talked about wanting to commit suicide and stuff. I recommend her some people/telephone numbers/anonymous chat organisations that could help her and broke off contact. \n\nOver the next two months she occassionally (drunk) texted me to tell me she wanted to date again. I kept saying I was over it, that I had moved on and that I didn't want any contact anymore.\n\nFast forward another month: she texts me pictures of an ultrasound, telling me she had become pregnant by me and had a miscarriage. I'm not sure if the pictures are legit - but there's a date on them that fits the timeline. I realise the morning-after pill doesn't have a 100% success-rate but she did get her period about 1,5week after the unprotected sex. Always used condoms after that first time. \n\nNow she keeps blaming me for everything. I figured I'd go with believing her story, had a convo via texts about how I'm really sorry this happend, that it was never my intention and that I should've used a condom that first time. However, she keeps saying I'm a horrible person for breaking it off with her, how it's unfair that I continue with life while she's had to deal with this, that she's mad and believes I treated her like a toy, and so on.\n\nI obviously feel bad about the whole thing and would like to hear your opinions. \n\nPS: I know I really fucked up having  unprotected sex with someone I just met an hour ago, after months I'm still mad at myself about it, but is there anything I could've done better after that fact?

		"story": "This is going to be kind of long: I almost killed myself last March, and I attribute it 80% to my parents. \n\nStrike 1: My parents were an absolute disaster during my high school years, and any time they suspect that I feel this way, they go on about how there's no rule book and they were doing the best they could. They did have a reason for being disasters: my baby sister died at 3 months old due to complications from surgery. My dad became extremely controlling (he had to know where my sister and I were at all times, who we hung out with, even where we picked up new words/phrases), and my mom became extremely depressed. She wouldn't acknowledge that there was an issue, though, so I went through high school with a narcissistic and controlling father and a generally absent mother. This all shaped the rest of the issues I have, some of which are detailed below. \n\nStrike 2: I was homeschooled from kindergarten through high school, so my parents affected and controlled literally every part of my life. I was told what exactly to believe, commanded not to question it, and fed a bunch of bs that anyone who believed differently than my parents was evil and going to hell. My entire freshman year of college I honestly believed that being gay was one of the worst things that anyone could ever be. I met my best friend that year, a very awesome, very gay person. I later discovered that I am bisexual. I haven't told my parents, since they always go on about how their friends with gay kids are so strong to put up with the \"choices\" their children made.\n\nStrike 3: I grew up in an extremely conservative Christian home that gave little credibility to mental illness. I'd really like to think that when I started showing signs of depression at 15 a serious conversation about mental health and an appointment with a psychiatrist would have not lead me to almost kill myself at 19. My parents did give me options: I could go see a Christian counselor who would tell me to pray more and give my worries to God, like what my parents had already told me, or I could talk to the family doctor. I was sort of fed up with religion at that point, so I talked with the family doctor. She said it sounded like I was depressed and gave me a bottle of pills. She told me to come back if they weren't working. Looking back, this was absolutely not an appropriate response to what I was dealing with, and it took me years to figure out I wasn't supposed to feel down all the time.\n\nI've talked to many trusted people about this situation, including the fact that the only way I see ever being at peace is to never have to deal with the people who screwed me up this badly again. Initially, I wanted to completely disown them, and after talking it out more and thinking on it, my counselor even agreed it would be a good thing for me if it's what I still want. I know family is supposed to be forever and all that, but I haven't felt love for them since I was a very little kid, and it stresses me out enough to be around them that it can trigger a depressive episode and make me question my safety. I even ended up changing majors so I had to take summer classes just so I didn't have to be around my family all summer. I get depressed even thinking about going back for the holidays. \n\nSo would I be the asshole if I sat them down, expressed my grievances, and told them I never wanted to see or hear from them again, for my own happiness and health? \n",

		"story": "LONG POST. \n\nTo start off. I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. ",

I'm very emotional right now and it's definitely affecting how I'm thinking right now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBackground: \n\nI got in a relationship with a girl I met online a little under a year ago. It's been pretty complicated. We never actually met, but that didn't stop me from becoming very attached to her. I had some trust issues and early on and ended up doing some snooping on her, I talked to her about it and we got in a fight and broke up but ended up getting back together later, it was rocky for a while but eventually we learned to get along and ended up making it work for a while. She's sick and has been for a long time. She ended up having to move in with her parents several months ago and our contact was strained during that time. We only talked a couple of times a week, she progressively got sicker and sicker over time but I stuck by her. Anything she needed I was there. I helped support her emotionally and financially. I really felt like I loved this girl. Eventually she even told me that once she got better she wanted us to live together, that she loves me more than I can possibly know for sticking by her side through the time she's been sick and waiting for her. My point here is that I felt very close to her and she felt very close to me. I've never felt so strongly about someone before. (I still believe everything she told me about her condition and I also have even spoken to her mother and her sister about it, I also believe that she did have feelings for me and even loved me). Onto the story.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNeither of us use social media very much, so I never cared before, but recently I had suggested that we be friends on Facebook so I could send her messages from my work computer, she agreed initially but then backed down saying that her family was uncomfortable with it since her last boyfriend had harassed her and her family after they broke up. So she told me that she was going to hold off on it and I said that I understood. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHonestly though, this dealt a huge blow to my trust, I felt like she was trying to hide something from me. I'm not going to go into huge amounts of details, but ended up finding her LoL account info and looked up her match history. I found games dating months back, she was queuing with her friends nearly every day. Days that she said she was too sick to talk, days she said she was even in the hospital. This led me to believe that she was on alternate profiles, or marking herself offline on discord and the like, so she could sneak around behind my back and do stuff with her friends, and not have to do stuff with me. (She did this before when we were fighting, but I didn't think she'd do it when we were getting along fine).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI called her today and confronted her on this. I did my best to maintain a level head, and gave her the opportunity to be honest with me first, and I told her that if she was honest with me that I was completely willing to forget about it. She flipped out at me and said that it wasn't her that she was letting a friend use her account. She told me I was a psycho for doing this again and that she was done and never to contact her again or she would \"fuck my life up\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut here's why I feel even worse about it:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe got into a conversation just a few days ago about us and we both reaffirmed to each other that we wanted to be together and that we loved eachother.

Just this morning she called me just to wish me a good morning, and to tell me she loved me. That's when I brought up what I found.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA for snooping on her?

So I stopped hanging out with her.\n\nI found out that her boyfriend might have been involved in a high-profile rape case, a pretty major thing. So I looked into it a bit, it looked like a case of mistaken identity, and that the actual person involved was his cousin or brother or something. They just had similar names. This is all based on an internet witch hunt, and those are not very accurate anyway. I knew that the witch hunt did target him though.\n\nI discovered that his cousin/brother/whatever was in junior high during the events of the rape case, and it looks like everyone else involved was in highschool, so I kept looking into it. Eventually I found out through a different source that one of his friends was involved in \"revenge porn\". Even if he wasn't the one involved in the rape case  directly, the fact that he's hanging out with people like that after  going through that witch hunt, after he saw that kind of revenge porn ruin someone's life. Well that's a huge red flag, and I couldn't keep  setting on it.\n\nThe problem is that it's all conjecture. I couldn't get any details of the \"revenge porn\" without pushing someone harder than I wanted to, and while it certainly looks like he was one of the rapists, the fact is that I'm basing that judgment off of a witch hunt. A witch hunt that got 2 people convicted (to probation, it was described in the news as a miscarriage of justice), but a witch hunt none the less.\n\nSo I let his girlfriend know what was going on. The guy phones me, understandably angry, and talks to me a bunch of facebook. After talking to him, I only feel more confident that he was involved. But I also have an obvious bias against the guy.\n\nIt really wasn't my place to get involved, especially where I had a crush on her, and I created a bunch of drama for what could have been no reasons.

I really enjoy cooking, so I'd often treat the guys to a big meal once every 2 weeks or so where everyone would pitch in and I'd cook the main course. This was the norm for the fall, but now 2 of my roommates Aaron and Stan (fake names) are on a diet and prefer going out every week for an expensive cheat meal. I was happy that I didn't have to plan a week ahead, but also sad that I couldn't cook for anyone but myself anymore. This past week I go up to Aaron and Stan and ask to make them a cheat meal, and they agree on my idea for mac &amp; cheese. I ask if I can make it a dinner party and invite some of my friends and they agree with that as well, making the total amount of people about 12.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAaron lets me know that he and Stan are more concerned about their meal and doesn't want to pay for everyone else's food. Understandable, since it was my idea to invite everyone. I ask him how much he thinks he and Stan will eat and he says 2lbs each. Using how much I've eaten in the past and how much Aaron and Stan will eat, I get what I think will enough pasta and cheese to satisfy everyone, which was about $50 worth and I get reimbursed by Aaron and Stan $10.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's where it gets weird. Aaron demands that he grate the cheese, not because he's especially good at it but because he missed his arm workout that day. I hand him the cheese and the grater and let him do whatever. Aaron takes the cheese and starts aggressively grating this cheese. Like, he's screaming and looks like he's trying to fist the plate into submission. After one poor, poor pound of cheese he moves onto the next one. I take the cheese and take a look at it before I dump it in the pot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are few tiny, red specks in there.\n\nHe cut himself on the grater and is bleeding into the cheese.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this point I'm surprised and disgusted, but I didn't want to say anything because he's acting like a raving lunatic. Right before the first mac &amp; cheese batch is done, the guests arrive. I finish the meal, toss on some breadcrumbs, and have all 12 dig in. Everyone's complimenting the meal, so I at least know that no one's poisoned from Aaron's lunacy. It took them about 15 minutes for all 12 guests to give up, with both pots less than half empty (Each pot had about 3lbs of food).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this point I'm pretty upset. I now have $50 worth of cheese and noodles that I don't know what to do with, except make mac &amp; cheese for the next month.

After she cancelled on a staycation a mutual friend and I were planning for her birthday (citing family commitments), she kind of stopped responding in the group chat. In the months that followed, she went silent, though there were occasional social media posts; and she was still posting active on her cats’ Instagram account.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor some reason, I got increasingly annoyed because I felt non-existent to her; she did not text me when I went on my solo trip overseas, despite sharing the excitement months earlier. She would react to other friends' posts on social media (some who aren't even close) but not once to my posts. It almost seemed on purpose. I realized much later that her personal Instagram account was no longer following mine (no idea when it happened), but her “cats’ account” was still following mine. I told the mutual friend about this, only to be told the 'unfollowing' could've been accidental, and that I might be overthinking things. At some point I came to a conclusion that the mutual friend probably knows something was up, but just didn't want to escalate matters.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBeing a passive introvert, I stopped initiating communication after attempts in the group chat got zero reciprocation from her. The only exception was wishing her happy birthday, to which she replied a simple “thank you!”.  I mailed to her some gifts over Christmas, and she didn't even have the decency to let me know she received it. I only knew she received it when I recently asked the mutual friend.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDespite wanting to consider that she might really be having personal difficulties and not wanting to be guilt tripped for being upset over all of this, I still eventually decided I’ve had enough.\n\nI unfollowed her on Instagram, later also removing her \"cats account\" from my followers, and I left the WhatsApp group chat. We are still on each other's Facebook, though she hasn't posted anything in 3 months. Either that, or she has been only posting to selected audiences to view (something she has done to others before). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI left things at that, but last week I received a tracked parcel from her.

I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't \"switch\" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, last week my ex contacted me and told me the \"good\" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to \"think of them\". I told him \"tough luck\" and hung up on him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying \"ask them\" in a snarky tone before leaving.

Out of nowhere, he comes ate me and tells me to go buy some Ketchup, because he needs 'em. I tell him to wait, as I'm playing, he tells me to go at once and I ask for him to wait again. He then scream \"dude, I'm cooking hurry\" and I say \"okay, lemme just--\" he slaps me on the head. Oh boy, I lose it there, I punch in in the stomach and he starts yo get all angry, full of himself. He nearly broke my 3DS too. So, I decided to go at once (sorry to whoever was playing with me) and on the way I shout at him \"piece of shit\" he instantly comes at me with his fist closed, with a grin on his face and by there I'm ready to (try to) punch him too. If it werent for my gramma, we would have fought right there. Anyway ff, he's gone, he text me asking if I'm angry, tells me he was wrong for hitting me, but I was also wrong for not \"obbeying\".  He then tells me that I don't have a job, I don't help with anything and that I SHOULD do everything someone asks me, and that we live in a society and some shit like that. I send him a long text explaining that I can barelly leave my bed, and That I'm bordeline suicidal, and that I feel like a leech for my family, and that its hard to even do most things when I feel like that. he just says that he understands, says that he'll kill me if I kill myself, but that I still should do everything someone asks me. He also told me that Im lucky I have a home, and that I'm not abused by anyone etc..\nNow, I'm not gonna lie... I'm lazy as FUCK. Like really lazy. All I do is take out the trash and help my gramma as she cannot move very well. That is not to say that I'm ungratefull for what everyone offers me (home, food, internet), I never complain, and I rarelly spend money since I dont leave my house really. Also, I AM looking for a job, I'm just not lucky with that. Later on my grandma said that \"we were both wrong because he hit me  but I also didn't obey\". I got so pissed, I said \"Look  HE was wrong, he came to THE HOUSE WHERE I LIVE house and started giving orders to me, and then hit me. I appreciate that he was making dinner, but NOBODY ASKED HIM TO, it was his choice, I could have made something else instead, so while im gratefull, Ill not suck his dick because of that\". My mom and her mother procceded to tell me that I'm wrong.. \n\nSo reddit, AITA for all that happened? \nAlso, AITA for being lazy in general?",

		"story": "I don't know if this fits here cause I'm also asking \"how am I the asshole\" because I genuinely don't know what I did but I must've done something.\n\nMy college roommate and I were paired up to be dorm roommates since first semester of college. We had a good relationship and moved into an apartment together the next year because we didnt have on campus housing. Things were great, we were good friends and spent most of our time watching tv together cause neither of us went out much. \n\nDuring the end of our junior year I got a boyfriend while on spring break. I'm very private about my relationships and rarely tell anyone if I dont have to. Once I returned from spring break I didn't have any desire to tell my roommate about this bf because in the past when i had opened up about relationships she was super judgmental to the point where I was upset the things she said. She is also exclusively into women so boys wasn't something we ever bonded over. I would've told her if he was going to be around but since it was long distance I figured it didnt affect her and wanted to avoid the judgement. \n\nWe hung out less and less as I spent more time at school doing homework or in my room skyping my bf. She was also gone a lot so I didnt think much of it. Eventually she started texting my other friends saying I was being weird and ignoring her. My one friend told me this and I didn't know what to say but didn't want to put that friend in an awkward situation by letting my roommate know she snitched. My friend just told her to talk to me, so I waited. She never did. She would just consistently complain about me to my other friends. \n\nBy this point I dug my heels in and refused to confront her about it because she was the one mad so she should come to me about it. This lasted for a few months and she'd act normal around me but complain behind my back. During this time my bf and I broke up and a very good friend of mine died along with other family issues. I didn't have the mental energy to deal with her as it was the least of my worries at the time.\n\nShe eventually got more frustrated to my face and would stop cleaning, told me not to use her groceries which we had always shared including things like salt. And she started closing her bedroom door because she was convinced I was messing with her stuff (we would leave our doors open when we weren't home so the other would know and not lock the other out.) I then started dating a friend of mine, a girl. She'd stay over some nights cause I was real anxious to be home alone with my roommate. One night we were...... doing things because my roommates door was closed so we assumed she wasn't home. Well I got a furious text calling me all sorts of names saying how dare I keep her up with my noise. I told her I didnt even know she was home and was not at all doing it on purpose. At one point she invited me to dinner cause I assumed she wanted to finally talk but she just started complaining about how bad her life was. \n\nWe lived together for a few more months until she moved out early and we havent spoke since.\n\nSo, what was it that caused her to react in such an extreme way?\n\nTL;DR spent less time with my roommate and didnt tell her about my long distance bf and she started talking shit to my friends and the internet but never talked to me. AITA for not going to her?\n",

That's been a little frustrating but understandable. My real annoyance comes from that over the past couple weeks she's made 4 dates with me, and then bailed pretty close to the date each time.

She responded that she was going to be getting off early on Wednesday and we should go out after. I agreed and planned on seeing her Wednesday night. Wednesday morning she texts me to ask if we're still going out, I confirm and we agree I'll pick her up from work. \n\nLater on in the day she texts me to say she still wants to go out, but she's gotta be home by 10:30. I was a little disappointed because she often doesn't get off until 9:00 or so, but it had been a couple weeks since I'd seen her so I agreed and told her to let me know when she would be off.

No response. \n\nToday, she finally texted me back over 24 hours later.

Recently friendo has been going through a bit of a rough time, and I’ve been trying to help them out as best as I can, and I guess they wanted to reward me (personally I don’t really feel it’s warranted, but I’m grateful nonetheless), and so in our typical fashion they decided to pick me up a game\n\nNow they’re also a frequent watcher of the youtubes, and someone they follow started playing a game very similar to the game I’ve rather unsubtly hinted at, and have been asking what I think of it. I’ve said I think it looks good, but Whilst I haven’t outright said it, I’ve tried to hint I’d prefer the other one (which I’d like to add is cheaper than the game friendo was talking about).\n\nTo round it up, friendo ended up getting me the second game, and whilst I’m grateful for the thought, I’m finding myself disappointed that they got me it instead of the other game I’ve been hinting at for weeks, I haven’t shown this at all to them, and I fully intend to give the game a go, I just wanted a second (or however many people) opinion on if I’m an asshole for being disappointed, and if I’d be the asshole if I kept hinting about the other game after a little while?\n\nApologies for the long post, TLDR:\nFriend who I’ve been hinting at wanting a certain game for a while got me another game of the same genre(?).

He insisted that he was fine. We talked about getting food before leaving but everyone said they weren't hungry.

I'm frustrated so I tell him we came there to play games so sit his ass down and stop talking about noodles. We play approximately two games before he falls asleep on the couch. \n\nCaleb, Rob, and I play another game while Mitch is asleep but they're really much better with four people so we head back to our respective places via Lyft. \n\nThe next day, I get a text (on the group text with Mitch, Caleb, and Rob) from Mitch asking everyone to each pay him $6 for the cab to his place. I sent a text back, \"No, that's part of being the after party host\".  A couple hours later, I get a request from Venmo for $6 (as did Caleb). I send another text explaining that I wasn't kidding, I'm not paying and that if we had gone back to our place, we would've paid for the cab. This dissolves into an \"epic\" text fight where neither of us are understanding how the other doesn't get that they're being ridiculous. My main argument is that he is asking to pay $6 to get home, while Caleb and I would pay a total of $26 to get home ($12 for the cab to Mitch's plus $14 for the Lyft).

		"story": "This happened last weekend but she's still not talking to me so I decided to bring it here for judgment instead.\n\nMy GF and I (both late 20s) have been together for about a year and a half. When I met her she was financially stable, though I make mid-six figures and she makes mid-five figures. I appreciated that she was frugal (as am I) and didn't waste money on things like trips or expensive meals out or material items no one needs. After a while she admitted to me that the reason she is so frugal is because she grew up very poor and does not have a safety net. Last spring she had an accident that resulted in her being in the hospital for some time and saddled her with a great deal of medical bills. From day one she was adamant that because we had only been dating for a few months, I was not responsible for any of her bills, nor did she even want me to know the financial specifics of them. I was fine with that and we continued as usual. I did notice that she has become more frugal than before and has acted as if she is under more stress, but I honestly thought it had more to do with the accident than anything else.\n\nLast weekend we met up with two of our other friends for brunch. My GF said she wasn't hungry and didn't order anything during the meal and just had a cappuccino and some of my home fries, but we all split the meal four ways anyway because that's how it is with these friends. It wasn't a huge bill but she was obviously annoyed about having to put her card down for it, even though we've all paid our share of meals where we had the smallest item before. Anyway, when we were on our way home we passed a woman selling tamales on the corner for $2 apiece. GF says to me \"Babe, do you have $2?\" I did have cash, but she had literally just sat through a meal saying she wasn't hungry, and I was embarrassed by the way she had rolled her eyes while settling the bill, so I told her there was a bank across the street. She went \"I don't want to have to take out a $20 just for a two dollar tamale,\" and I told her \"Fine, don't get a tamale then.\" She got really quiet and went \"I'm just really hungry,\" and I kind of snapped at her and told her that she should have ordered something at brunch instead of just eating my leftovers. Then she told me that she has been \"food insecure\" over the past few weeks because of her medical/credit card debt and that she didn't have the $20 in her bank account to take out because she had to pay at brunch.

I haven't spoken to her since it happened on Sunday.\n\nI don't think this is fair for a number of reasons, the biggest being that I'm not a mind reader and wouldn't know anything about her finances because she expressly told me her medical bills were none of my business. I highly doubt the \"food insecure\" claim, but either way, she has been way too eager to let me pick up the bill when we go out to eat over the past couple months (even though at the beginning of the relationship we always split it evenly, or she'd pay if she ordered the more expensive thing). She makes a salary and I have no reason to believe she can't afford food to eat, so I'm pretty sure this is a guilt trip situation. But like I said, she hasn't spoken to me since Sunday and it's Thursday morning, so I am looking for an objective opinion: am I the asshole for not giving her tamale money, or does she need to realize that she can't keep mooching off people just because she's in debt?",

Now when I was told that I’d got the contract, they said I had to keep it to myself until the end of the temp contract, which I did, I didn’t speak to anyone about it and basically acted like I was leaving too.\n\nAfter she left, I found out that she had been talking to another co-worker saying that she couldn’t understand why I hadn’t told her I’d got the job because we were apparently super close friends, then she started texting me, like A LOT (she’s got my number off the work WhatsApp group), and if I didn’t reply to her within an hour or so, she’d Facebook message me and WhatsApp message me saying she didn’t understand why her messages weren’t getting through to me, it was bordering on harassment to be honest. At one point, I didn’t get back to her for a whole day because a string of family emergencies (a family friend passed away, my parents house almost burned down and my sister went into labour all in the space of about 24 hours), and when I finally checked my phone, I found a really ragey text saying she didn’t understand what she had done wrong and that she would delete my number and never text me again. I told her what had happened and she said she obviously hasn’t deleted my number,  then took this as an invitation to repeatedly text me again.\n\nI know her husband died a few years ago and she’s in her 60’s so she’s probably super lonely but I’ve not text her since, aita?",

He's funny and personable, if a little quiet. \n\nBut Paul's wife Sharon is... something else.\n\nThe few times I've gone to their house, Sharon has been nothing short of frigid. She is silent aside from \"hello\" or \"goodbye\". She will stare daggers at you the whole time you are in her presence, like you are completely inconvenient to her existence. Basically from the minute you walk in their house, even if you've been invited over, it feels like she is counting down the seconds until you leave.

But then it came to my attention that she has made multiple posts on her social media denigrating us and our relationship (usually alongside denigrating Paul).

		"story": "TL;DR. My mother mistreats me and my little brother but I don't know if I am making it worse. I feel like my lack of contribution around the house is not helping, and while I'm trying to fix it, I'm busy with school and constantly tired. I just want to be able to be a normal teenager--make mistakes and slack off sometimes--but I don't get the chance. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mom has had abusive tendencies since I was young. Her first response to my negative behaviors as a child was to beat me, and when I got too big to beat, to yell and scream, knowing quite well I was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder. She treats my younger brother similarly. He's 8, I'm 16.\n\nHere's an example of her behavior.\n\nA few weeks ago, she sent me in an Uber to pick up some food for her from Popeyes'. She demanded a particular deal that involved a leg, wing, and thigh, as well as a biscuit and drink, for 3.99. I knew damn well they didn't have that, especially in the pricy neighborhood I was in, but I asked anyway. I'm cripplingly shy, so I didn't want to press the issue, and bought her and my brother tenders by mistake.\n\nWhen I brought them home, she FLIPPED OUT. An honest-to-god screaming fit, tears, voice-breaking, the entire 9 yards, hollering she didn't like tenders, she wanted (insert dead bird parts here). To me, they're the same fucking bird, but okay, I guess. The part that pissed me off was when she insisted I didn't care about her because I didn't know she didn't like tenders. To this, I asked her which condiment I preferred--barbecue sauce or ketchup. She said ketchup. I like barbecue sauce. She insisted that it wasn't the same thing, and said I was inattentive.\n\nLater, she \"apologized\". Well, not really. She forgave me for bringing her tenders and said she appreciated my efforts. She did not say sorry for calling me, in so many words, an awful daughter. Over fried chicken.\n\nTo me, it was a completely childish response to a relatively simple problem. Howling your lungs out like a four year old because you got a piece of a bird and you wanted another piece of a bird is not how adults should behave. If I, a hormonal teenager, who has panic attacks about makeup sponges, can understand that, a woman in her forties certainly should. \n\nHere's another example.\n\nToday she screamed at and physically threatened my 8 year old brother for emailing the teacher about a missing assignment--to clarify, she asked him check Google Classroom, and he misunderstood . I was too afraid to go look, but based on the changes in her voice, she hit or pinched him at least once. In the same paragraph of speech, she insisted that TV/computer use is making him stupid and then said that he wasn't stupid and could listen to her. \n\nNow, from what it you've just read, she seems like an asshole. Granted. \n\nBut today, after more screaming when I told her she's always angry at us, she brought up two things: one, that I am ungrateful, and two, that me and my father aren't doing enough in the home to help my little brother.\n\nWith the first, I can kind of understand where she's coming from. In her mind, she's never wrong, and for me to be upset with her to the point of crying for throwing a skirt at me seems like a ridiculous and unfair thing to do. I disagree, of course, but I see her logic. \n\nWith the second, she's right. Completely. For a lot of my life, my dad has been just \"there\". He provides, and sometimes talks to me, but he doesn't try to do things with me or take me anywhere. He doesn't really give me advice unless I ask for it, or tell me to do anything if it doesn't directly pertain to him (i.e. I don't want to do this, so do it). He's the same way towards my younger brother (with some improvements). But my mother has made my brother into a little tyrant: he doesn't listen to or respect anyone but her. He fusses at me and is short with his father. We can't really tell him to do anything, and I can't really make him.\n\nAnd I admit, I am a lazy piece of shit. My room is a disaster, and other than taking care of our three dogs and making sure they're fed, clean, and toileted, I don't do much. I try to help with the sink--make sure stuff doesn't build up in there, and that kind of thing. I'm a senior in high school--I skipped a couple grades--and just generally going through some tough stuff right now, so it's kind of difficult. Studying for tests, keeping my grades up, making sure I graduate by getting my service hours--it's a lot on my plate. My workload has increased 1000x since last year.\n\nI'm also super irresponsible. Just in general. I'm working on it, but I feel like I lost a good chunk of my development to depression in the 8th, 9th, and 10th grades. I feel stunted.\n\nAnd I'd just like to share that until very recently, my mother didn't do anything around the house. She has walked the dogs maybe 6 times in the two years we have lived here (she forces them to be in a little room near the garage because \"she doesn't like animals up under her\"\\[our dogs are cuddly\\], and complains that my room isn't clean enough to have them live permanently with us). She does not wash dishes, nor clean up after the rarity that she cooks--she recently started baking bread, and leaves the sink piled high with dishes every time. She then proceeds to complain that the sink is full of dishes and no one is doing anything about it. \n\nBut she works a lot. She just graduated school and is running three businesses. I feel like she resents me a little because I was born at a time that wasn't opportune for her and disrupted her life. I do feel like she's in the wrong a lot, but I want to extend sympathy to her. I can't imagine the amount of stress she's put herself through for us, and I am grateful for what she has done. I just wish she wouldn't treat us like shit and say it's fine because she provides for us. I didn't choose to be here. \n\nShe is not open to communication, and no amount of discussion will fix this, so I just want to know: is this entirely her fault, or are me (and my father) partially to blame?

I wasn’t super happy about it, but I put up with it because I know that she has been there for me when I was sick.\n\nNow, whenever my dad or me gets sick, we take a range of different medicine regularly to try to fight it off ranging from DayQuill/NyQuill, to zinc tablets (which have been clinically shown to shorten colds), to Dimetapp at night. Apart from that, we drink lots of liquids.\n\nSo as I’ve been taking care of her, I suggest that she takes some medicine, but she rarely would take anything except for Advil, which lowers her fever I guess. To top that, she would drink barely any fluids (like maybe 10-12 oz per day).

He obliges initially for a little while, but then he begins to become a little more persistent while also requesting that I pull no punches on his, making sure to really \"push his shit in.\" His words, not mine. Anyway, I finish up and begin working on his  starter pack when he says that anything relating to him \"acting smarter than he actually is\" is low effort and unoriginal.\n\nHere's the thing about T. I mentioned that he was the \"pretentious\" friend, but in general he's a pretty good guy. However, sometimes, he gets too big for his britches and I feel like I need to knock him down a few pegs, so hearing that I should pull no punches on his starter pack, I went all out on him. Over the next couple of days, I made a giant collage of all the weird and strange things he tends to do, but also went after all of his deepest insecurities in making his starter pack as he had requested.\n\nAfter it was all done, I immediately thought that perhaps I had gone a little too far. However, persistent as he is, T demanded that I post it. I really hesitated posting it, even going so far as to make him sign a \"consent form\" for what he was about to see. I upload the image and immediately T shits on it, calling it unoriginal, low effort, disappointing, and 0/10. I felt a little bad as I had worked on this for a few days only for it to be put down, but whatever.\n\nHowever, things got weird from here. Following this, T completely and suddenly disappears off discord and cuts all communications with the friend group for the next two weeks, deleting his discord account one week in. Rightfully so, the whole group starts to get increasing worried about his whereabouts as we try to contact him to no avail. A few hours ago, though, one of my other friends broke through to him to ask what happened to him, only to learn that he left because of the image that I had posted.\n\nAm I the asshole? Did I go too far in trying to roast him?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

She would expect me to pay on our dates etc. (This is normal, I get courtship, and continued doing this for some time) until things got more serious. 2 years or so into our relationship we began splitting tabs when going out etc. we made roughly the same income and were students at the time... little did I know that she resented me for this.. she hated splitting the tab and bills after we moved into together. She always believed the man should be the breadwinner. Despite us both graduating from college and getting good jobs, I still feel the tension is there. We now combine all of our finances. I make roughly double her income now... but I know that if I made less than her, we would probably argue a lot more. Her mindset is even applied outside of finances. She simply believes that the man should take the burden of everything. She believes her gender allows her a free pass to bend the rules. We fight about this constantly. I feel that she has a double standard when it comes to our relationship. She can spend money on things because she needs them, but I’m rarely ever allowed to spend money without her complaining. Funny thing is that when it comes to chores, she wants 50/50 in that area.. seems pretty convenient... She’s like a “selective” traditional gal. Fall back on her gender roles when it’s convenient for her, but become a feminist when it’s not. \n\nI’m at my wits end about this. \n\nSo AITA for believing this??

While I was out of the country last summer, one my roommates (J) basically redecorated and refurbished the place.

She is currently about 8 months pregnant. She has gestational diabetes, so she is forced to eat a diabetic diet and check her blood sugars.\n\nThroughout the pregnancy, she has been on and off about eating healthy and checking her sugars. She was very busy with work and school during the first trimester, so she primarily ate fast food between classes, etc and didn't check her sugar. I didn't really find out about her diet until later on when she said she was too busy/stressed to eat healthy.\n\nI try to do everything I can to help and be supportive. I almost always have a diabetic-friendly dinner made for when she gets home and lunches packed for her. If she is out running errands and hungry, I tell her to text me before she gets home and I'll make sure there's healthy food ready for her. I also do the majority of our cleaning to keep her from being stressed. In my mind, we're in the pregnancy together, and I want to do everything I can to help keep her and our baby healthy.\n\nFor awhile, she was rarely taking her blood sugar. She was busy, stressed, and I think the pregnancy emotions were making things very difficult. After eating fast food (5 months pregnant), she came back home and I told her she really needs to take her blood sugar. She was annoyed, but took it to basically appease me. It was almost 300. For those unaware, those are dangerous levels. She took that as a reality check and started to manage her gestational diabetes better.\n\nShe finished school around 6 months. For the next couple months, AFAIK, she was doing better. The other day (8 months pregnant), she came home with fast food. I asked her why she didn't message me to make her food—she said she didn't think about it. I don't expect her to be perfect, so I just asked her to please take her blood sugar in an hour so we can manage it through exercise or whatever if necessary.\n\nAn hour passes by, I remind her, ask her if she wants me to get her supplies for her, etc. She said no she'll get it. Another 20 minutes passes, she said she is busy scheduling appointments. I told her I would literally bring it right to her since blood sugar is time-sensitive, and that her health is more important, but she needs to take it. She throws her papers in the air, yells that I'm annoying and nagging, and storms out of the house.\n\nI can see how it can be perceived as nagging, but it's not only her health, it's also our daughter's. It's frustrating because I'm completely reliant on her actions—all I can do is try to make sure we have healthy food available and ready. We had a rough last pregnancy (ended up fine and healthy).

He is 27(m) and I am 25(f). When we initially got together he didn't mention the kids and so it was a surprise to me . Kind of a turnoff but I liked the guy so I stuck around. His kids mom is as crazy and obsessed as they come . Everything the first year was an issue because I was in the picture. She wouldn't let him see his kids ,and she'd pick and choose when and where and for how long. He would go without seeing them for months due to this. His kids are small 5 and 3 both girls, sad thing is due to all of the drama his 5 year old has the mentality of a 15 year old and carries out insults and conversations her mother talks to her about to try and cause friction. Now ironically his 5 year olds birthday is on Valentine's day . For some time his mom or sister would be the ones to contact his babymama for visits . Just recently tho his babymama said that wasn't good enough and needed to have direct contact with him or no go on the visits. It's really bothersome to me because of how toxic she is . So my boyfriend is trying his best and has begun messaging her and calling her to see his kids which he hadnt seen in 3 months. The other day I asked if he was gonna ask to have her for Valentine's to which he said yes . I gotta admit I was bummed .. things have been Rocky lately and Idk what I expected but that wasnt it. I got a little quiet with him and he got really upset and said I was being dramatic and that he sees me all the time. He also told me that he needs to be a dad and to stop thinking the way I do because its stupid.\n\n I can't put myself in his shoes as I don't have kids and I wouldn't know how to deal with this but I also feel so much pressure. I really tried the first year we were together by doing birthdays and holidays with them but I always was talked negatively about from both his family and his babymama. I got tired of trying and I stopped coming around especially because his oldest daughter would say things like \"daddy my mommy was showing me pictures of you two kissing , you love my mommy huh\" he would just tell her not to talk about those things and that,that was a long time ago ... Honestly it would get me really upset because I know she doesn't come up with those things on her own.. as I mentioned before I've been around going on 3 years now ,the other day i seen his kids and his oldest said \"hi  ohh what's your name again , ummm ,umm hey you what's your name?\" He told her stop playing you know her name and she got serious and said oh yeah I remember now .. idk why but that really got me going...

I don't know any other way to put it. New people are oftentimes ignored if they need help. We are barked at for not doing things while we're in the middle of doing those things. More than once I have cried on my way home from work because of how cruel these other girls could be.\n\nI thought maybe it was me so I changed my attitude from dreading going there and taking everything really hard to a positive attitude.

They didn't need to say that. \n\nI made a very dumb mistake and I owned it but one of my co-workers threw paperwork at me and yelled at me that she wasn't doing her job because I screwed up my job and that i would have to do both.

She was trying to give me more work to do when I was supposed to be going home shortly. I told her that it sounded like another shift should do that, as I was going home very soon, and she said \"well then it'll never get done!\" Which I guess is a compliment but by then my feelings were in the gutter and I burst into tears. \n\nI clocked out early against the rules and went and cried in my car because I had really tried that day not to let the bullying get to me but it didn't matter how hard I tried, they wouldn't stop and eventually I broke. \n\nSo when i got home I posted this thing talking about my experience there. All of the new people who started with me also have similar experiences.  I deleted the post very quickly but a girl still took it to one of my bosses and I only found out about it last night.

We live with roommates as it's a 6 bedroom house. We rent the rooms with all utilities included, access to the pool, laundry room, and both patio areas are open for them to have late night guests. We offer them cheaper for students, as that's who we mainly attract being close to the university. In doing so we share common areas. The kitchen being one of them. I cook, A LOT, and whenever I cook, I always tell the other three people living here that there is plenty of food for them to share, and most nights they will come and join us for dinner, or at least eat leftovers. This is done out of generosity because I see how hard a lot of them work, and two of who are here from out of state and away from family. This is where the problem started, and I thought should have ended. \n\nAbout three weeks ago, I took my wife and son out to a Japanese restaurant. My wife loves sushi, and that is our treat usually once a month. My son loves teriyaki so it's a win for everyone. After eating, my wife ordered two sushi roll to take home and eat with the movie we picked for that night. So we grab the to go sushi and head home. A few hours after arriving home, we start popping corn for the movie and my wife noticed her sushi is gone. We asked around, and sure enough the only make tenant we have ate them. Actually went into the bag, opened it up, and ate her two sushi rolls. About 16 pieces. I was flabbergasted. I asked him very angrily why he would do that, and he says, \"You always offer us lunch or dinner, so I thought leftovers would be the same way.\"\n\nThat to me screams entitlement, and I am not excited that my wife's food was just taken within just a few hours of even being purchased. He obviously saw that it was not leftovers either, but an entirely separate purchase. \n\nI discussed with him that it was not acceptable to go into our possessions, whether it be food or otherwise, and to use common sense before eating anything that is not his, as I have NEVER ordered takeout or from a restaurant for these tenants before.\n\nThis brought up a discussion with the other tenants, and we discovered that one had actually purchased a mini fridge because her food would turn up missing also. When confronted with this information, the food thief admitted to drinking her iced coffees, her cheesecake, etc. Overall, not fucking cool. We told him he had 30 days from the first of this month to be out, because he violated the tenant agreement by stealing others belongings. We have to look out for those renting our rooms, so the eviction was a mutual agreement. \n\nHe argues of course, but ultimately knows he can do nothing. Yet, he now knows he has nothing to worry about with stealing food. So yes, food has been disappearing ALL week from everyone.\n\nHere is where I need an opinion. I want to buy a nice steak and leave it in my car for a couple days, then prepare it with some veggies and potatoes and leave it on the refrigerator, obviously for the food thief to eat and get sick.

I’m now a college freshman.\n\nThis all happened in my freshman year in concert band. There happened to be a kid with autism in my class. The first day when I met him, we chatted about random stuff like football and other sport-related things. I can definitely tell without anyone telling me that he has autism, as I worked as a ilc tutor for most of middle school. I am totally fine talking and hanging out with pretty much anyone as I don’t care what a person looks like as long as their actions aren’t bad. Things are going smoothly, until 1 day about a quarter way through the semester he asks me a very inappropriate question relating to my genitals. I tell him “that’s not an ok thing to say” and everything is fine. Or so I thought. Throughout the next month the frequency of these sorts of comments increase, as do my response intensities. It got to the point where I felt sexually harassed, and I started telling him to “shut the fuck up and leave me alone, asshole.” He went away after that.\n\nNow it’s at this point in the story where some of you are gonna say “just tell a teacher,” and yes, I agree, that would be a great thing to do except since he has autism, unless he physically does something to me, the teachers won’t do jack shit.\n\nAfter I said that to him, the next day, he started saying that he was going to get me expelled from my school because I was a discgrase (bad spelling sorry). I had enough at this point so I started messing with him a little bit. I went along with his game, and every time he would say something about me being a bad kid, I would go along with it and make up stories about being a criminal. (My favorite was telling him I was a time traveling bank robber.) other than this, I didn’t say anything insulting to him. \n\nOne night, after a concert, his twin brother who doesn’t have any mental handicaps told me to stop messing with his brother or he would beat me up. I stopped after that and just avoided the kid entirely. \n\nI know it’s been like 4 years, but this still sticks in my mind.

I just really need a neutral perspective on this. \n\n  I have ADHD, which makes it pretty difficult to sit and focus in class without doing something with my hands. In highschool I'd find myself constantly doodling to help me listen to teachers. Through both highschool and college I've never really had any problems with it, until today. \n  \nCurrently I'm taking a communications class that's required of my major. Everyone gives a speech in class every two weeks or so. This class goes for 3 hours, so going in I knew I'd be fidgety. I got my speech out of the way and started drawing in my sketchbook. \n  \n It must have taken her sometime to notice me, because in the middle of class after a student gave their speech she called across the room for me to close my book and pay attention. She then announced to the whole class about how doing anything besides listening quietly was unacceptable and horribly disrespectful. Everyone went on break for a few minutes and I had time to put away my things.\n \n This is the part that probably puts me in asshole territory. If I was smart I would have not done anything and just sat quietly. But this is the 3rd time this professor has passive aggressively lectured me in front of the whole class, so I was feeling pretty grumpy. I didn't want to risk disassosiating and getting anxiety because of this teacher. So I took out my smaller sketchbook and turned more towards the speakers to show that I was paying attention. She was not happy about this.\n\n  After class was finished she told me to stay when everyone left. She then berated me about how horribly disrespectful and distracting I was to everyone. Because of this I'd be losing 10 percent of my grade on my own speech- and she was going to bring it up to the chairman because me drawing was that problematic to the rest of the class. She went on to aggressively tell me how horrible I was for a good few minutes. Even after explaining why I was doodling she said she didn't care. because I didn't have an accommodation letter, she couldn't(wouldn't) accept the excuse; and that other kids in class have problems and don't bother anyone in class. \n  \n I think she handled the whole situation rather horribly, but she has a point- I should of gotten some resources from my school's student disability services awhile ago. No matter what I end up doing I'm definitely going to talk to them about accommodations in the future so situations like this don't happen again. \n\nI grew up being a good student, so I'm honestly not used to handling teachers that don't like me.

Our relationship started off a bit strange and we did things that people who aren’t just friends should do, but both of us knew it wasn’t serious and it was never like super over the top or anything. I joined pretty late in the semester though and didn’t realize that Michael was close friends with a girl named Amy.\n\nAmy was dating Ben, but I quickly found out that Michael was desperately in love with her. They were best friends and always talking and he fell HARD for her. She would tell him that even though she was dating Ben, she and Michael were meant to be together, that she was in love with him too, that they would get married right after college. Michael, meanwhile, kept attempting to convince her to breakup with her boyfriend so they could be together finally. It was a shitshow and Amy’s boyfriend was aware this was happening the whole time and would mock Michael about it constantly. There was also a lot of evidence that Amy had two boyfriends (not Michael, it was another random guy outside of our university), but Michael was blind to it and supported her 100%. Anyways, eventually it became obvious that Amy was just stringing Michael along to get a higher position of power within the club. I convinced Michael that Amy was toxic for him and that he needed to cut her off and he agreed, although he didn’t really want to and Amy ended up leaving the club. \n\nA couple of months later, he called me and told me that Ben and Amy had broken up and I told him I was really concerned because I knew they still talked sometimes and he told me that he just wanted to be there for her because he had experienced a similar breakup in the past, but that there was no romantic feelings between them still.\n\nSure enough, a couple of weeks later I find out that they’ve started dating. I know she’s no good for him whatsoever and frankly, I’m tired of having to deal with all of the drama she brings to Michael’s life. There’s a lot more details about why I just don’t support this relationship or really want to be friends with him while he’s dating her, but these are the most major reasons. I sat him down and told him that I was going to quit the club for a while because I’ve become more busy with schoolwork and that I think he and I should stop hanging out or talking. I never specifically told him it was because of Amy, but I think we both know it is. I feel like shit because he seemed so crushed and even started crying, but I absolutely refuse to clean up after his relationship with her anymore and watch him suffer while he’s with her.

Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not.

My mother actually made him my godfather *because* she knew I was biologically his. I suspected for a decade but didn't know till I got the test\n\nBefore my bio father became estranged to us he had a son with his girlfriend. I met the son when he was a newborn. The girlfriend left with the son to another state and my bio father left us to be with her a while later. Didn't talk to him for over a decade. We still don't really talk and I found out the girlfriend became his wife and they're now completely separated. They had two more kids and he's not allowed to see them, so I can't even speak to them through him.\n\nOut of curiosity I decided to look the son up since I remembered his name and realized he'd be a teenager. At one point my bio father, who lived with us at the time, was going to seek custody of him. So for a few months I anticipated this kid being my little brother.\n\nShockingly, the kid looks *exactly* like me. His childhood photos look exactly like my nephew. My sister is also my godfather's, we knew that for sure 100% for years. She took her own test and it says we're full siblings.

		"story": "Throwaway because I'm curious and don't know if the couple uses reddit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the backstory: I own my home and in order to help with costs and savings I rent out the rooms in my home. I won't get too into details about this but recently I have been struggling financially for external reasons so having room mates has become a must. I have a three bedroom home, and typically only ever rent out one other room which is across the house. I live in a fairly nice upper-middle home in a quiet and safe neighborhood. I keep the place clean (I clean thoroughly once a week, I dislike messes) and all I really ask for in return is that payments are made on time and that you are kind to me and my fiancee. The rental agreement I provide is just a month-to-month agreement and it is fairly generous and lenient for the person renting the room. I do my best for background checks, personality checks, financial reviews, and etc. prior to accepting people in. The room costs typically $600 a month with a $350.00 security deposit which I return after inspection. This amount includes the monthly rent, internet, utilities, and pretty much everything minus their personal expenses. I do ask that they not let my two kittens outside (they're indoor cats) and that if they're going to use something (like plates or laundry detergent) that they just ask in advance - I'll likely say yes. For reference, the typical rent in my neighborhood for a room is about $1200, or $1800 for a one bedroom apartment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo due to recent financial struggles I had agreed to let a couple live with me. I figured I would give them one room with a discounted rate (Instead of $1200 for two people, it's just $800) and I would agree not to rent the second room while they are here (which means I'm earning less per month since not both rooms are rented). They did advise me they would have March as their last month as the girlfriend is pregnant and the baby would be due in late March. This was in November. I felt for them and wanted to help, and additionally I really needed the money at the time as my previous tenant had to leave on short notice (He was really nice though and we worked it out amicably, although at my financial burden).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInitially everything was fine but we started noticing many issues. They would drink and eat our food without asking. They would use stuff without asking. At one point early on we found one of my favorite cups was being used as a cup-holder for their toothbrushes under the sink in the guest bathroom. The girl (who is pregnant) is leaving cigarette butts outside my home and she also spends her time drinking on my patio and leaving her mess behind. They tamper with my thermostat and cause my electric bill to increase by about 60% (when I typically account for about a 40% increase with new tenants). Additionally, they started using my garage and extra room as storage despite being advised not to. I had to confront them on each issue and they pushed back either saying it wasn't them or they wouldn't do it anymore. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow normally I'd be furious but I wanted to best assist them so I let them have these extra luxuries at no expense because it would be easier than arguing - and I also couldn't find new tenants to replace them despite my many efforts.\n\n  \nFast forward to today, the rent is due and they advise me they are leaving in two weeks and they only want to pay for half the month. Now our agreement in no uncertain terms says they need to give me a 30 days notice and they owe for the remaining thirty days. I attempt to be nice but before I can text a reply the boyfriend sends me a huge insulting text message saying \"We are leaving because you neglect your cats and they have fleas. We should've gotten a thirty day notice on the fleas and we can't live like this so we deserve to not pay you the full rent.\" Later on he agreed to pay the full amount and \"we will discuss prorating it later\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, my kittens are everything to me. They're indoor cats. Me and my fiancee spoil them. Recently (as of about 15 days ago) we discovered a flea problem. Immediately we notified them, bug-bombed the house, brushed them, shampooed them, gave them anti-flea treatment and they came back again as of yesterday; so I intend to get in contact with an exterminator to see what options are available (as they may be in places I can't get to with conventional means).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis ended up being a longer post than I intended so I'll include a TL;DR at the bottom, but am I an asshole for demanding they pay the full rental amount as agreed by on our contract - and even more - I provided them official thirty day notice as of today to vacate?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: I accepted a pregnant couple into my home with a month-to-month agreement. They're trashy people and I've been nothing but kind while they drink and smoke on my patio together. Today they asked me to only pay a part of their rent and leave early, violating our monthly agreement which puts me in a rough financial spot.",

They are extremely strict about having a pristinely clean house, like more than most people, so we respect that and we clean as much as we can, but its really helpful to have a proffesional come in with more tools and cleaning solutions then we have in the house.\n\nIts really important that they clean the downstairs floor extremely well, like the living room, kitchen, bathroom etc. I didnt want to hire them for the bedrooms or upstairs bathrooms we can do that ourselves. But this is the first time using this app for hiring and instead of choosing the hours that you want, you have to input the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you have and the app decides the amount of hours it will send the cleaner for.\n\nI played around with it so that it gave me a 4 hour option, so i diddnt input the amount of bathrooms and bedrooms that we actually have or ot wouldbjave hired the cleaner for much longer.\n\nSo it comes to this morning and I realise, that the house is really clean, this time my parents went away, we diddnt really have anyone over as usual, the downstairs bathroom was barely touched, we diddnt use the kitchen much, but i wasnt going to cancel obviously. The cleaner arrives, I explain to him how important that the downstairs area is prristine, all the mirrors floor etc. So IF he has time, he can move onto the areas but no pressure on the upstairs just go through the downstairs.\n\nHes done downstairs in less than 90 minutes, thats another 2 and a half hours left, so i take him upstairs and show him the bathrooms and bedrooms and he gets really angry, he says \"THIS IS NOT FINE, ITS NOT WHAT YOU LISTED\" I explained like i did when he arrived earlier, that the only important area was downstairs, and to do as much of the upstairs as he has time for.\n\nHes still huffing and getring annoyed saying that what I did was wrong but ive explained that he only needs to clean for the time I hored him for and then leave. Even of its not finished upstairs but hes still not happy.\n\nI dont know was I wrong for not listing the full size of the house, is it a strict rule when you hire a cleaner online that they do only the rooms listed, im thinking of complaining becaise i really diddnt like the attitude.\n\n",

I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that.

I know stories involving abuse are touchy here because it usually falls under the 'validation seeking' post category, but I swear I've thought this over. I'm never this divided when it comes to my mother.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr: My mother was abusive so I stopped reacting to anything she did, but recently I've caught myself becoming more and more cruel towards her, to the point that when she said she just wanted to die, I asked her why she hadn't. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little background: my mother has been abusive as far back as I can remember (so, since I was 7 years old.) It went from degrading my physical appearance to attempting to kill me a few times. I'm not blind - I know what she did was horrible. I'll never forgive her for it. \n\nHowever, I've been acting like a real piece of shit the past couple days, or maybe even weeks. She's been trying to be nice ever since I ran away a month or so ago, I can tell, but apparently that just makes me more angry. She hasn't been too abusive in a few months. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the actual story. Two days ago, I was in my room, getting nothing done as usual. My mother comes in, obviously wanting to talk about the meeting she'd had the day before with my maths teacher (about me missing way too many classes and my grades dropping.) She asked - in a sweet voice that made me want to punch her in the face (goes to show how weirdly I've been reacting these days) - why I'd been missing those classes, listing off potential reasons. I'd had a less than ideal day, so I just wanted to be left alone, and I got annoyed really easily. I snapped. \n\nUnfortunately she just cranked up the whiny tone. Started talking about how hard this was for her (which I get, honestly, but in that moment I wasn't hearing it), and eventually she said the magic words \"I want to die from how tired I am because of you.\" \n\nI was too mad at that point to watch my mouth so I just asked her \"why not do it, then\" in a complete deadpan. I wasn't looking at her so I'm not sure what her immediate reaction was, but when she next spoke I'm pretty sure I heard choking up. \n\nI felt nothing in that moment. That's what makes me so conflicted. I didn't even think in that moment, I let myself go and stooped to her level. Said the words she used to say to me. Afterwards, thinking it over, I felt bad - not for her, not really, but for having been that much of a shithead to anybody. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have two entirely different parts of me that are at odds right now. Half of me just wants to dismiss it - I want to tell myself that I'm not the asshole, that I'm justified because of what she did to me before. But the other half is reminding me that no matter what, it doesn't change the fact that I practically told someone to kill themselves. And she's been trying to do better, I'm just actively making it hard for her. That's definitely asshole material. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't know. I need help in figuring this out.

		"story": "So, some backstory first. This will be long, very long, I apologize. TL;DR at bottom. \n\nMy dad has always had terrible anxiety that he never bothered to treat for a variety of reasons. He is terrified of public transit, high winds, pit bulls, crowded spaces, so many things, and it's a very legitimate fear to him. Sometimes he seems to know his fears are irrational, but that doesn't stop them. This has shaped my childhood in many ways, for example I wasn't allowed to get my driver's license until I was 20 but also not allowed to ride my bike anywhere farther then a mile away, take the bus, or ride with any but a few friends of mine he trusted. Growing up with these restrictions and fears turned me into a bit of a nervous shut-in. At 22 I started to get very sick, we later found out I have multiple sclerosis. This ramped his anxiety up to a new level and also ensured I would be living at home with him for much longer. During this time my parents took care of everything I needed, even though I could barely move. Medical care cost them more then I can ever pay back and they don't even want me to pay them back. I am very grateful. \n\nMy boyfriend of the time understood I needed extensive care but was also going crazy living at my parents' home, so he invited me to live with him. My dad didn't allow it but I left anyway. After a few months he understood and accepted it. It helps that my then-boyfriend now husband is a wonderful person and my dad loves him.\n\nA few years later he had his first heart attack. This ramped his anxiety up again but also prompted him to finally accept treatment. Sadly, he stuck with the first medication he was given and it only works a little bit and he left his first counseling session in the middle and refuses to return. Still, his anxiety went down for a while and our relationship started to flourish. I even managed to have a few conversations with him about his overzealous restrictions. \n\nWhen I was 29 four major things happened: I got unexpectedly pregnant (surprise! You're not infertile!), something horrible that is a different story left my fiance and I effectively homeless, my dad had a second and much worse heart attack, followed by open heart surgery, and my MS went into remission. All of these things sent my dad's anxiety spiraling out of control. He can't sleep, he has lost way too much weight, he doesn't eat much, and he is well on his way to a third heart attack from anxiety alone! But he will not have the doctor look at his anxiety medication or return to counseling. \n\nMy husband and I frantically searched for a place we could afford to rent that we could move into right now and would allow our pets and actually found the perfect place... directly across the street from my parents' house. It won't be so bad, right? Plus, it's not like we could find another place like that on such short notice. We knew we were wrong when my parents cornered our new landlord and managed to convince him to give them our keys. Naturally, they made copies of every single one. We very excitedly prepared for our baby, and I started moving around and getting out more, realizing how hard life can be when you are unable to get out at all. We learned that I was capable of caring for a child with a few accommodations in our home but still not able to hold a regular job and I became a stay at home mom. It didn't take long before it was glaringly obvious I could not raise a healthy child shut in the house, so I learned how to use public transit. \n\nNow, I am 33 and married with a healthy, very active, and not remotely anxious four year old son and another son due in March. I am mostly blind and my MS has returned, but it's not as bad as it was. I am very familiar with the public transit system in our city, and it's not a bad one. My dad is retired and spends most of his time watching our house from his kitchen window. He calls me to ask where I am going and ask me not to go there every single time he sees me heading anywhere, even the grocery store he wants to come with. Everywhere non-essential he tells me not go. If he had his way, his grandson would never go to the park or public pool. He regularly goes through my mail and even more regularly lets himself in my house, where he proceeds to fiddle with my thermostat and simultaneously lecture me over a mess that usually doesn't even exist and also lecture me for \"pushing myself too far.\" My son thinks his grandfather is the best thing since ice cream and I don't want to separate him but he is starting to avoid some of his favorite activities, such as digging in the dirt, because his grandfather told him it is too dangerous and this is infuriating me and potentially harming my boy. \n\nFor a while I would compromise by staying home about half the time he asked me or asking him to drive us instead if it bothered him, but this only made my dad more upset and he started to do things such as hide my stroller or \"borrow\" my cane to make sure it was very hard for me to get anywhere. Keep in mind that I may now be a grown and married adult who takes care of myself and my own with an involved and loving husband, but the idea of telling my parents \"no\" terrifies me and I just can't bring myself to do things that will probably burn bridges with them, such as changing our locks or reporting my dad for tinkering with our mail. So now I just take the longer path out of our neighborhood, trying to stay in the blind spot I know my parents' kitchen window has, pretend my phone is broken and sometimes doesn't ring when he calls, and go wherever. I guarantee my son has benefited from seeing more places and getting out to play more often, and I have benefited as well. My dad however, gets nearly apoplectic. I have tried to talk about it, but he asks me to \"compromise\" each time for his sake, but there is never anything for me in his supposed compromise. I know this is making him nervous and paranoid and putting his heart at risk, but frankly he would be nervous and paranoid anyway. \n\nTL;DR: Life makes my dad nervous and he wants me to never do anything ever, he watches me to make sure I never do anything. I recently realized I am an adult and can ignore him so I do stuff anyway. Turns out I like doing stuff.\n\nSo, Am I The Asshole for ignoring my dad's anxiety and not staying home with a rambunctious preschooler, even though it could possibly help him avoid a third heart attack?",

I asked if 60 days (notice we have to give apartment leasing company and term of rent that needs to be paid) was enough time for her to get a new place? She said yes- I also offered to put in the 60 day notice later, effectively buying her more time to search for a place as well.\n\nOn Tuesday, I told my RM I think we are about to go under contract on a potential home and that SO and I would pay for any termination fees and of course our portion of rent/utilities during the 60 days. Asked RM if she needed more than 60 days to find a place, she said no, she was planning on moving into a 1bd/1bth in the same apt. \n\nOn Thursday the home deal fell through and we are back on the market so I informed our RM that we were back on the search. She said that she was planning on going to the leasing office tomorrow to sign a contract for mid April for her own place. She asked to be let out of the lease and obligations here as she wants to just get the move over with. I discussed with SO and we agreed that we could cover her portion of rent starting May. I inform roommate we would cover her portion of rent beginning May, but that she would still be responsible for her portion of March &amp; April rent/utilities, to which she agreed.\n\nYesterday RM goes to the leasing office to sign her lease. I get back home from work and calculate out how much her April rent/utilities are and inform her for the power bill I would let her know once I got the bill. She responded back 'ok'. 15 min later, I get a text from RM who said she doesn't think its fair that she should have to pay rent for a month that she wont be here. She gets home &amp; she informed me that she signed a lease for mid March for her own place, because the leasing office offered her a \"better deal\". I asked her wasn't she planning on moving mid April, why did she sign for mid March? Her response was because of the better deal and she wanted to just get it over with. I told her I would need to discuss with SO and see if we could let cover her portion of rent for April. I point out to her that even if SO and I closed on the house, everyone would have had to pay the apt for the 60 days of rent (March &amp; April) for the apartment.\n\nAfter much discussion, SO &amp; I agree that it's unfair for us to become burdened with her portion of rent for April just because she wanted to move out earlier and signed a contract without informing us.

		"story": "So I just discovered this subreddit and thought I would ask this question because its one that I have been wondering about and my family isn't really objective because they will simply take my side. I had this friend in high school that I would constantly go to parties with and play video games with and we had a similar sense of humour but I really didn't like him for a number of reasons:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- He would always need money. He would want me to buy him food, he would need me to buy him cigarettes (I hate smoking so this really pissed me off) and he would also want me to give him money so he could buy weed. It got to the point where he owed me at least 200 dollars. Remember, this is high school, money is scarce and every amount of it I had, my parents are asking what I did with it. It pissed me off that I would be decent enough to give him some of the money my parents would allow me to have to spend on things I wanted and he would never pay me back and joke about how he never would like it wasn't a serious issue for me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- He would take advantages of privileges my parents would afford me and ruin them. An example is that my dad would let me use his car every so often but it cam under the condition that I treat the car with respect and this friend would constantly insist on smoking cigarettes in the car and would light up without asking first. I got in trouble multiple times because of this and had car privileges revoked. He would also say we should just smoke weed in the car and then drive back to one of our places like driving under the influence wasn't a big deal. What if a bunch of intoxicated 16-17 year olds get pulled over by the police while high out of our minds. My license would get taken away and he didn't seem to care. Just do it! Whats the big deal??? And he would act like I was being a bitch about these things.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- He wanted to smoke weed every day. I am someone who has a bit of an addiction problem with weed. If I smoke it every day, my grades tank, I start putting on serious amounts of fat, and generally become a less functioning person but he insists on smoking it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo basically what I did was continue the friendship until graduation and then when I didn't need to see him again, I cut all contact and never spoke to him again. He would continue texting me for a few weeks after that wondering what was going on but I didn't respond. I just ghosted him hard and I feel bad about it sometimes. But I've barely smoked week since and lost 40 pounds and put on a bit of muscle. My grades in University were actually similar to those in high school which is unheard of. I'm just a better person and many of the goals in my life couldn't be achieved while catering to the type of lifestyle he insisted on if we were to continue hanging out. I don't really have any friends from high school though because they decided to stick with him rather than me. My relationships with my parents has improved drastically though and I've made better friends since. Maybe I should have handled breaking off the friendship differently. I don't know. I do know that he was not good for me. Am I the ass hole?",

A bunch of things had gone wrong that day and I was running fairly late for an appointment with my therapist. I was not in a good mood. \n\nI was riding on the  subway when two guys walk into my train car. One of them seemed fine but the other was holding a bottle of vodka and couldn't stand up straight. It was pretty obvious this guy was very drunk. He became annoying very quickly as he started ranting about nonsense to his friend. Although he hasn't harassing anyone he was just generally being rude and annoying and combined with all the other shit that had gone down that day, I was pissed off. I took my phone out and I wrote a message in one of my discord groups complaining about my situation. \n\nI then somewhat jokingly wrote in reference to the drunk guy \"what a degenerate\". Now I know that the word degenerate can have some rough connotations, so I just wanted to clarify that I didn't mean it in the way a nazi would use it, more of like the live in your mom's basement, NEET, piss in jars, sort of degeneracy. Anyways my friend in the discord chat basically called me out and said I was being unnecessarily cruel and an asshole. I was more surprised than anything because this is a guy is someone who usually doesn't care about what you say; you could spout every racial slur and swear word in the book and he wouldn't care. I pointed this out and said he was being hypocritical, because he had made fun of me for getting offended by language in the past. He argued that this was different because I was specifically targeting an individual. \n\nIn the end I apologized and he expressed sympathy as well. The drunk guy got off the train a few stops later, and everything was put behind us.

Using a throwaway account because I'm not super proud of myself.\n\nSo before I continue, I need to tell you that I've always felt insecure about my looks, and my average height and average build - or even below average growing up. I've always had interest in sports and all things considered \"masculine\" but I've often been left out of matches, sporting events, bachelor parties etc because I've always tried fitting in with the more masculine tough guys, and although they've always been formally nice to me, I don't think anyone has ever seen me as their peer. I've learnt to accept it, but it's always been a mild frustration for me.\n\nSo about two and a half months ago I joined a new firm, and everyone has been pretty welcoming, inviting me over for a drink after work etc, but I've started noticing the same pattern. Guys playing sports over the weekend don't invite me, or don't take my comments about sports, or relationships etc seriously... Again the big guys have their own circle where I don't feel like I fit in. But there is this one guy who's been very friendly, helpful and overall did everything he could to help me adjust to the new environment. Now, this guy is about my age, maybe a few years older, everyone at the office likes him, he's a great worker, and physically he's very imposing, tall, good looking, well built... everything I've always wanted to be, and more than anyone I've known he's shown interest in my opinions about sports, politics, relationships etc, and he's invited me to matches, sporting events and such. I know it's childish, but this really made me feel like I was finally accepted into the \"boys club\" after feeling left out for most of my life, because I didn't look right, or wasn't tall enough, confident enough, or whatever it is that someone did or did not see in me.\n\nSo a few days ago we went for a beer after work, a couple of us colleagues, and after everyone else went home, my new friend and I talked about women and relationships for a while, and it turns out he's gay. I've never had a close gay friend, only a few good acquaintances I share with my girlfriend, and like I said earlier, I've always supported and respected the LGBT community. But I have to admit that I was kind of disappointed that this guy is gay, because I've always wanted to have at least one friend like him, who would share my interests and who would accept me as I am, but I always assumed it would be a str8 guy. Am I the asshole for being disappointed here, or am I just overthinking this?",

		"story": "I know that this may seem like some angsty teen (f15) thing but this is actually really bothering me. My parents are divorced and I live with my mom and her boyfriend of about 6 years. Him and I used to be pretty close until he started becoming really manipulative towards my mom, then towards my sister and I. Let’s just say my sister and I aren’t drinking his shitty grape flavored bootleg kool-aid. That causes quite a bit of friction between us all. For example, this weekend I was at my dads house (only me, my sister (f19) is still out of town), which is usually a hard time for my mom and her boyfriend because they are not on good terms with my father, so generally when I get home from my fathers house my moms boyfriend is pretty irritable at times, other times he’s pretty cool. Today I came home and I was wearing a cropped shirt (which I am not allowed to wear, but my mom will allow it if I am wearing pants that are high waisted or a shirt under - basically if my stomach isn’t showing). I had just gotten out of the car and my stomach was showing a little bit because my pants had fallen down a little; before I could pull my pants back up or even say hi to him the first thing he says to me is him getting on to me about my shirt, and I mean he’s pretty aggravated about my shirt. I might be a brat for this but it upset me a little, so I said “well it’s nice to see you too.” with a bit of an attitude. He got pretty mad. He proceeded to tell me how I don’t respect myself because I dress like a whore and that he didn’t care if everyone else in the world does it, I can’t. I get where he’s coming from and all, but he couldn’t have said hi to me first or at least approached it better? He’s never been a father before he met my mom and doesn’t really understand how fragile a teen girls self confidence is, my mom said something to him about it, but then he told her that she’s making him out to be the bad guy because she doesn’t want to parent me. This happens quite often, but only when he is feeling stressed/insecure, which he just got bad news on Friday at a doctors appointment (he has type two diabetes and is in denial about it). I know he’s just trying deflect some embarrassment onto me, but Im getting pretty tired of it and beg my mom to leave him all the time. She says that he is her soulmate and that she would be miserable without him, but by staying with him she’s slowly losing her daughters. I persistently tell her that but it just angers her even more, ever since she’s met him she’s completely changed as a person. She’s I love with him and I know that she hasn’t had that in a very long time, so I feel like a bad person for resenting someone she views so highly. Im probably just going to move out after my senior year and only visit them once a year or so. I feel happier when I’m not around them and I think they’re happier without me.

I do find it unfortunate that, in that post, the fiancé only mentioned this after the pregnancy. Regardless, a couple of years ago, an ex-girlfriend of mine told me she was pregnant (two days after our breakup, ostensibly by me). I told her that whether to keep the child was her choice, but that if she wanted me to support this child and/or any of the medical costs of the pregnancy that there would have to be a paternity test, and that if she wanted to do it after birth I would pay her back half the medical costs then. She got furious at this, and it turned out later that the whole thing was a fabricated attempt (literally using a pregnant friend's urine) to manipulate me into getting back together. (She had BPD, long and fairly hellish story there, hence breaking up with her to begin with, though I hope she's doing better now.)\n\nSince then, though, I've been pretty conscientious about being up front about this. Any time things have gotten serious with a girl, when we have that conversation about wanting kids or not (I very much want kids), I make sure to mention that I would never, regardless of any amount of \"trust,\" put my name on a birth certificate without knowing for a fact the kid is mine. Even for a second, third, etc. kid with the same partner. Pretty much no ladies have had a problem with this.\n\nThe responses to that post, however, seem to be full of people asserting that the fiancé should just trust her and not take into account the massive financial, legal and time sink that can go into raising a child that isn't yours. People said he acted out of, for instance \"irrational fear.\" Given the average $233k cost (not including time and energy) to raise a child, and the $500 (max) cost of a paternity test, simple math tells us that if there's a 0.2% (500/233,000) chance of infidelity, it makes sense to get a test. And I mean, while everyone should trust their partner... why would you not make such a *tiny* investment to be safe?",

I just don't necessarily agree with it. \nM: I'm not doing this again. I've dealt with Christians that thought like that, no, I just can't do this again.\nH: But I'm not homophobic.

About 30 seconds later, she came from the opposite end of the isle and told me to have a great day/weekend. I smiled whilst not even looking at her, and said \"uh huh or sure\", she stood there for a couple seconds and then left. Two things before I ask if I'm the asshole in this situation.... \n\nFirst, she didnt buy any buns or bread and just left the isle.\n\nSecond, I was listening to \"baby shark\" because my friend texted me before I went into my shift saying \"DODODODODDO\" An thats what I was listening to for most of the interaction.

I love my partner more than anything in the entire world and I could not picture my life without her. Haley and I have been together for about 4 years. When I was much younger I dated a woman named, Marie. Marie and I met and instantly clicked and what I thought was us getting on like a house on fire quickly became one of the most intense and darkest relationships of my life. It was abusive on both sides and not healthy at all. I believe it’s safe to say it was highly toxic and codependent but the draw was magnetic to say the least. Once Marie and I ended things we didn’t talk for several years, up until about 2 years ago, when she reached out seemingly out of the blue. I had been to therapy and worked out a lot of my issues (many of which revolved around my sexuality) and she had to. While catching up we both made amends for what had happened and seemed to move on with our lives. \n\nHaley knows all of this and was supportive in me getting closure on what was a terrible time in my life. I even showed Haley every message as it came in. At the end of the conversation with Marie Haley said she felt that it was great I got closure but asked me to sever the relationship permanently. I agreed. \n\nOnto the present: Marie has reached out again maybe about 3 months ago and we have talked every day since. Sometimes it’s about small trivial things and other times it’s about tougher emotional things. Marie was recently there for me about a death in the family- this was a family member she was particularly close to when we were together. At first I told Haley about the conversation and she brushed it off as sort of a do what you want but don’t tell me thing but I could tell it made her uncomfortable. I don’t want to stop talking to Marie and I really consider her to be one of my closest friends at this point, at the same time I don’t want to hurt the trusting and loving relationship I have with my wife.

This is a long story so I will have to give a lot of background...\n\nI (M21) have been with my girlfriend (F20) for over 2 years now and we have been long distance (LDR) for 1.5 years in college. It was a great relationship at first but things have really gone downhill since then. I believe it's been her mom.\n\nHer mom has always been suuuuper involved in our relationship. Like, she knew right away when we had sex for the first time, knows every single date we go on, and knows every argument we've been in. That last one is the main point of this post.\n\nMy girlfriend tells her mom everything. I find the \"my mom is my best friend\" thing a bit much but I can live with that. But it's gotten to the point of telling her to not give me attention, ignore me, not ask me what's wrong, and saying stuff like schools first and things of that sort. I know that's her mom telling her to say that stuff because she wasn't like this before.\n\nWe haven't had sex in a long time because she thinks that's all I want, when it never used to be like that. Her mom also says she \"just wants her to be happy\" but that's a way for her to want to know everything and tell her what to do. Her mom thinks she's right about everything and I hate that attitude. \n\nIt has gotten to the point where I can't express my emotions because then it comes out as me \"not being confident\" or \"having trust issues\" when all I want is more communication in our LDR and more affection. Her mom is completely controlling her emotions and her life and it's taking a huge toll on me. I don't feel like I can keep this relationship going. \n\n**My girlfriend has specifically said she SENDS her mom texts before she sends them to me for APPROVAL. Is it just me or is this weird?! I'm close with my parents but would never ever do that.\n\nFor the record, I am not needy or clingy. All I ask her for is a 15 minute phone call every 2-3 days when we're away and that's apparently too much even though we barely communicate over text. I know her mom is telling her to say \"schools first\" because she's used that BS line on me before. So manipulative and controlling.\n\nShould a mom have that big of an influence on her daughter's relationship, even though she's in her twenties?

At the time I came out to her we weren't super close, but she kind of forced me to come out and she ended up being super supportive. Flash forward a year I come out to a mutual friend of ours (we'll call him B), and he confessed to me that A had told him a while ago, about a week after I'd come out to her. Now, I'm not super confrontational, but I was upset so I called A to talk to her about what B told me and immediately denied it, saying she would never hurt me or betray my trust like that, then she states he must have figured it out himself because I don't look very straight. She was adamant that B was lying, but when I pointed out B didn't have any reason to lie and she started crying, \"how can you not believe me?\" I got really uncomfortable so I offered to talk to her about this a different time when she'd calmed down but she seemed even more offended by this saying she didn't need me to coddle her feelings. Okay, that's fine, but as the conversation progressed she got so emotional I ended up hanging up. I called her the day after to talk about it, and she was determined that B had lied, and that she was upset that I didn't believe her. She said it so forcefully I started to believe her but after pondering it for a bit I decided I wasn't entirely sure if I did believe her and that's where the tables turned. She started screaming about how we were \"basically best friends\" and \"how can you believe him over me?\" In the end I backed down and said I believed her even though I didn't.

		"story": "I apologize that this is *extremely* long.\n\nSo he's not my roommate any more. He moved out last week.\n\nHe was and is a great friend, and we'd known each other for years. We were pretty tight and he knows probably more scarring secrets about me than any other person on the planet. He came from an abusive home life where was homeschooled, had information like his SS card and birth certificate hidden and withheld, his dad held him emotionally captive, and his step mom was verbally and physically abusive. Prior to moving in with me, he stayed in the adjacent house belonging to his dead grandmother, with no plumbing or electric. He's from way up north.\n\nA few years into our friendship we resolved that when I got my own apartment in my current town, the stars aligned; it wasn't instant, but I moved him down here, much further south. I helped him get his paperwork in order to get the documents necessary for job hunting.\n\nDisclaimer: I've never lived with a roommate outside of family and one year of college. It does not suit me, I do not like it, and I appreciate my privacy. I've not been in a relationship for more than a decade. I'm 27 now. He knows all of this.\n\nI moved him in anyway, out of a brotherhood and deep friendship. We'd never actually met face to face, so I cautiously added him as an additional occupant rather than another party to the lease. This protected me, but it also gave him the benefit of ignoring rent aside from just paying it to me.\n\nWhen he moved he didn't have a job; it took four months. I paid for those first four months, rent and food and utilities for the both of us. I also helped him get his job, just a mere ten minute walk away (he can't drive). I'm not trying to get points. I'd never ask for repayment, but I feel it's important for the ensuing events.\n\nWe agreed he would simply pay half rent, no utilities, and could help with the groceries later. In exchange he did the lion's share of the chores and cooked (something no one wants me to do). Rent went up $25 and I just didn't bother making adjustments. Utilities only amounted to about $150 all told, so I ate the costs.\n\nChores: He washed the dishes because without him there wouldn't be a mess to wash, and he was paying less for exactly this purpose. When he moved in there was a flea problem as well as a roach problem, so he was also vacuuming every day. As the fleas got under control, he vacuumed once or twice a week, and then stopped entirely. The roaches also got under control, and then he got lax about doing the dishes and leaving trash in his room (both things I explicitly discussed with him long before he moved in). We did the laundry as needed, and I take care of all cat related chores and costs (I have two).\n\nAll was fine until he started seeing this girl. He'd started getting lax already, but when they started talking it really went downhill. He grew increasingly distant and would chat with me briefly and then lock himself in his room for hours talking to her every night. Before I said something about the volume he never even shut his door.\n\nFirst she constantly wanted me to text her as well, and chat, and we'd all be friends. That's just not my personality, nothing against her. Then I'd be going out the door to work and she'd be meeting me at the door to come in. Then she'd be there when I got home. This happened a couple of times before I set some boundaries. I said some stuff about not wanting her to be here all the time. I have a tone problem I've been told. One day they weren't here so I texted to see if they were coming home with a lighthearted joke about being able to strip down and do whatever if they weren't, which apparently made her uncomfortable (even though I didn't text her) because I'd been so cold leading up to all of this. Then they got here and my roommate made her stand outside in 30 degree weather under the assumption I didn't want her inside at all, which I clarified was not the case. He came to get her things, but when I told him they could come the fuck inside because of course, it's freezing, they went into his room, shut the door, and stayed there for 4 or 5 hours until about 1AM. I worked the next day, and it's a small apartment.\n\nSo I clarified my rules.\n\nThey were simple rules, maybe a bit strict. Basically it was just \"be mindful of my schedule, don't have her here for ages if I'm going to be home, and don't have sex on the cats (a real rule I added to express what I thought was the levity of the situation...and also I didn't want to clean splooge off of my cats)\". These were never respected to any real degree. She just ended up being here one specific day a week (a work day for me, so I got to come home to it) until about 1AM each time. I never said anything about it directly, but my frustration probably showed.\n\n*Then* things got a little more tense, about a month later. I was sick one day, and he made dinner shortly after I woke up in the evening. The evening before was her usual evening, and they were together the whole time locked in his room until the usual time. While I was preparing to eat, unshowered and looking a mess, he lightly and happily added that she was also on her way over because she wanted some of his tortellini. Well I lost my cool, snapped, and told him that it was inconsiderate and I was going to go take a shower. He didn't understand *why* I thought it was inconsiderate, and neither did I. He told me I didn't have to get ready or anything just because she was coming over. I disagreed. I later realized the reason I was upset was because he never even thought to ask; he just invited her. He doesn't need my permission, but that had just been our relationship up to that point. The jury was still out on whether I thought any of that was fair.\n\nAnyway I sulked in my room, and didn't speak to anyone (pretty much no different than any other time they were here except I wasn't sulking). Finally he opens the door and tells me she wants to talk. I don't want to talk, and tell him as much. He repeats his statement, I say \"[Roommate], I don't want to talk to [GF] right now\". I need time to think through my emotions, or I say things I don't mean or haven't processed fully. A few seconds later she barges into my hallway adjacent to his room and starts going off about how I have a problem and we're going to discuss it. I just continued sitting at the computer, looking away from her and doing my thing while she rambled on, getting frustrated. Occasionally I'd reiterate that I didn't want to talk right now. Didn't matter.\n\nEventually she gets me to crack and I spout off a laundry list of problems I have, largest of them being the slacking off of chores (in private I also explained to my roommate that when I'm here I'd rather they be playing Smash Bros. together in the living room than locked in his room fucking, or taking showers together). As I listed off my problems she'd give me a sassy \"mhm?\" and repeated this about 7 or 8 times. Finally I stopped complaining and simply said that \"her sassy 'mhm's?' weren't doing her any favors and the longer she went on the less I wanted her here at all\". That ended the conversation, and later she apparently cried. I was fully prepared to not speak to my roommate until after my pre-planned vacation, but he was amenable the next night, and we talked it out. He also talked it out with her, and it didn't go as smoothly behind closed doors. Full disclosure, I 100% eavesdropped on the conversation against my better judgement.\n\nAll I asked him to do was watch my cats while I was gone for the week. They were free to stay here and do whatever. I also found this an appropriate time to raise his rent from $400 to $500. I didn't do this solely as a punishment, though; I did it in exchange for doing *all* the chores. I would clean, wash dishes, and deal with the miscellany on top of what I already did. He told me he thought he should *only* pay half. So I calculated it for him.\n\nThings went on pretty much the same after I got back, except I never saw his GF again. Period. It went back to talking on the phone, except this time much earlier, and for much longer. He pretty much stopped cooking or doing anything outside of his room. Then he told me he was moving out, last week. He had applied for a job and had an interview; if he got it he was going to move out. I didn't realize the urgency in all this when he said it. I literally did not see him again after he told me he had the job. He stayed over at her place for several days, did a few more interviews...and then I got an email from my property manager saying he'd removed himself from the lease. An hour later he texted me and told me he wanted to give a proper goodbye but \"needed to get early rates on the apartment\" as if he couldn't move his stuff after signing the lease, and had moved all of his stuff out; he can't drive, so he just wasn't going to go to his last few shifts for his old job. The only job he's ever had. He had to pay the security deposit so he had to split his payments. He'd already paid me half earlier in the month before he mentioned anything, and then paid $150 with the breakup text he sent me. Conveniently he only paid $400 the one month he'd been asked to pay more. And like that he was gone. He asked me to hold his mail.\n\nWe exchanged some words after this all settled in, and, well, frankly ESH for the texts. Basically I just wanted more time; he'd needed a month if he was on the lease! That's after the fact, though. It hurts having to suddenly make up for $400 a month I didn't have to worry about, and it hurts that he basically did all of this behind my back. Mostly I just feel betrayed, but I'm not sure how at fault I am for the way this has all played out.

We have an attic which we keep a bunch of random stuff in. \n\nOccasionally Ill need something from the attic, and I end finding a bunch of other old stuff. About a year ago I found an old tin with my pokemon cards in it.  They were all curled and dusty from age so they were all worthless. After finding them though, I started to get back into collecting them. \n\nI dont have that huge of a collection now but I do have a few nice cards that Ive pulled that I keep in binders in my attic. (My parents didnt really know I was collecting again before the incidents)\n\nSome days of the week my elementary school aged cousin comes to our house after school to wait for his mom to get off work (shes a nurse). My parents went through the attic to find any of my old art supplies they could find for him to keep himself busy.\n\nThen though, they started pulling out my binders of cards to show and probably give him. I got kind of lucky and walked downstairs immediately after he opened the first binder to look and I just said something along the lines of “Just remember, please only look at them and don’t take any”. And he said okay and that was that. It was just me and him in the room. \n\nAbout a week later my mom knocked on my door and asked if my cousin could have my cards. I said he can look at them but I really dont want to give them to him. We bickered so we just made a deal that I would give him a couple of them. We went through them together and I gave him some cards that I had duplicates of that he wanted, and I actually probably gave him about 60 different cards. So you know, a decent amount to an elementary schooler. Again, all was fine. This happened in the early summer of 2018. \n\nAlso, I told my mom later why I didnt want to give them away. \n\nLast week, my cousin came and knocked on my door and asked if he could have my cards or if “I still liked them”. I apologized and said that I did still like them, and he said okay. I learned later that he came down the stairs dissapointed. Ever since then my family seem to be annoyed with me.  I asked my mom about it and she said that nobody could understand why I wouldnt just give the cards to him, and I explained to her that I had spent money I earned at my job on many of the cards and I actually use (trade / sell / play) them, and they probably would just sit on his shelf. \n\n\nTLDR; my elementary age cousin wants Pokémon cards that I bought and my family is annoyed at me because I dont want to give them to him. \n\n\nSo AITA? I understand he is only a kid and also part of my family, and I honestly do feel kind of guilty by not giving them to him.  But I bought them with my own money.

BF and i were wanting to on a trip alone just the two of us this year, and after a day of searching fun things to do on a weekend trip, i just asked if we can go to the beach for a couple days for a long weekend, just to relax together. He mentioned bringing FR to the beach since he works long hours and deserves a break, this way it would be cheaper and we can go the whole week to the beach instead of three nights. I agreed, under the circumstance that we get a hotel room with two seperate bedrooms. We found a decently priced condo on the beach, two levels. One bedroom had two queen beds and the other had one kind bed. Because we are dating and FR doesnt date anyone, naturally we took the king bedroom (also its the master bedroom and has beach views and its on the second level loft of the condo and I'M SO EXCITED, as a side note).\n\nI told FR we found a condo, he'd have his own balconly overlooking the bay, his own bathroom and his own bedroom.

I tailgated a car for some time, honked at it, and blew past it, inadvertently cutting him off and forcing him to brake. I admit I made very poor choices; I’ve learned from them and matured as a driver since. \n\nThe man (a very big, early 40’s guy) at the next red light, got out of his car, stormed up to my window, and went ballistic. He spat on me, screamed a series of **extremely** vile racial slurs, death threats (including graphic references to lynching/hanging) and obscenities at me and **my two small daughters** for a full 2 minutes (impeding traffic for some of this time). He screamed **so** unbelievably loud, got freakishly red, the veins started popping out of his head; I was honestly expecting him to have a stroke or burst a vessel. But worst of all, my kids and I feared he might hurt or even kill us.\n\nThe incident terrified me, but scarred my daughters. They cried and cried, had nightmares about the encounter for a long time afterwards, and I had to have some very long discussions with them that I really wished I would not have to have until they were much, much older. The incident sickened and enraged me like nothing I have ever experienced. I just so happened to catch it all on my dashcam; I turned the cam towards him the moment he started in (as evidence if he were to assault me), and saved the footage on my computer just in case I ever had another run in and needed evidence.\n\nCut to two years later. I’m at an upscale brewery/restaurant with some buddies, look over at the bar area, and who do I see behind the counter, dressed in a nice suit and managing the bar? **The raging driver.** Still bitter, I made eye contact with him, and he froze like a statue and went white with shock when he saw &amp; recognized me. Throughout that dinner, I continued to torment him with a series of sly little grins. When I left to take a bathroom break, he approached me.\n\nHe apologized to me profusely. He claimed he’s severely bipolar and that that was one of his manic outbreaks; he assured me he is not in any way racist or violent, and that if he could do anything to take back his words, he would. He claims to have since gotten his life together; having gone to therapy, gotten medicated, ended his drug abuse habits, etc, and promises me that he is a very changed man. I responded by telling him I still have that video of him raging, can destroy his life and career with a single click, and promptly walked away.\n\nI’m very seriously considering sending the video to his manager, AND even posting the video publicly on social media. Now I know the guy’s name and more info about him, and that he works (and might live) in my close vicinity, I realize it could really make a splash.

		"story": " \n\nFirstly, my (20m) girlfriend (19f) and I have been very very happily dating for just over 5 months now. We are each other's emotional support through everything and we do everything together. Very recently, my phone broke down and I do not have the financial means to obtain a new one at the moment, so she being the saint that she is let me borrow her old phone that she kept around. When it has WiFi I can use things like snapchat and instagram just so I can contact her.\n\nIn using her old phone, all of her old apps and pictures (including her tinder) are available to me. She did not explicitly state anything about me not going through all of it when we weren't together, so I figure she just assumed I would, but I honestly have not whatsoever. I respect her boundaries and privacy, and figure most of the stuff I would find in there happened before we ever even met and I would not be happy with what I saw, so why even bother.\n\nThe problem here arrives when I received a notification about a day after I received her phone to use. I got a notification from instagram, but as her account. At this point I had not used the app yet, so her account was still signed in. However, when I opened the app to see what was up, it prompted me to log in - I could not use her account, yet I was still getting notifications from it. It was at this point that I was going to sign in with my own credentials so as to not get her notifications, but what I actually did I am slightly ashamed of. I read the notification and saw that it was not from anybody she normally talks to, or anybody that I know. It was from a man our age that goes to our university, and the contents of the messages made me not want to sign out. I became extremely anxious because his messages went something like this:\n\n\\- \"Hey\" (11pm the night before I saw)\n\n\\- \"Good morning Beautiful\" (the first notification I saw in the morning)\n\n\\- \"Were you at so-and-so's concert last night? I think I saw you\" (I took her to a nearby musician's concert for a celebration, I bought her tickets and just the two of us went)\n\n\\- \"What are you doing later?\"\n\nNow I cannot see her messages that she is responding to him because since I am receiving her notifications, I am only getting his messages. I do know that she was responding though based on the fact that he liked one of her messages that she sent to him. I also know that after the last message he sent there was no other contact. She does not have him on any other form of social media, so instagram notifications would let me know if anything else happened. I do not know what she said, if anything, to the last message.\n\nSo I suppose this is the question - AITA for not signing out of her account upon seeing those types of messages? Should I confront her about this, or let it slide for now as he seems to have stopped talking to her?",

His parents consider me a son (I've been known them for well over ten years). Kara comes from a wealthy family. Four years ago, I met Kara at a hospital internship and introduced her to my friend group. Kara and Jim started dating last summer and she moved into Jim's room within the month they started dating (Jim is working on his second bachelor's, so he lives in his parents basement).\n\nThis semester I moved in with my SO (dating 5.5 years now) to her dorm at school. My home life isn't the best, domestic abuse and all that, so I was ecstatic for this change. Each person in the suite has their own room and bathroom.\n\nSo the semester goes on. Kara's parents don't know she is living with Jim, so they are still paying for her dorm room (about $14K a year). She uses it as a glorified supply closet, Kara slept there maybe once or twice. At Jim's house, Kara does not do her own laundry, do chores, or pick up after herself. As Jim and Kara have been together, Kara has distanced herself more and more from the group.\n\nOverall, Jim and Kara's relationship is so-so. She says she has anxiety driving, so Jim drives her to school even on the days he doesn't have school. Keep in mind, it's a 30 minute commute. The last time Jim told her he can't drive her anymore, she gave him the cold shoulder for days until he started driving her to school again. I think Jim just stays with her because she likes video games.\n\nDuring the semester I am taking a full course load and working three jobs. Christmas rolls around and we throw a party. Before everyone gets there, Kara makes a comment about how surprised she was that I am at the party instead of working because \"all I care about is money.\"\n\nI make a sarcastic comment agreeing with her, that all I care about is money. Kara says I \"am mooching off someone else's money\" (referring to me staying with my SO in her dorm which my SO's parents pay for). I point out that maybe she should care a little more about money because of her dad paying for her dorm she doesn't use while she mooches off her boyfriend by living in his parent's basement. She leaves and doesn't speak to me for 2 months.\n\nToday I asked Kara, nice as you please, if she has a problem with me. She says yes, she hates me, and she doesn't want me in her life anymore. She already told Jim I can't go to their wedding (they aren't engaged?) She goes on ad nauseum about how much she hates me and how I am the worst person alive. I implore her to tell me what I did wrong, or what features about me are so awful. That way, I can work on them, and maybe become a better person. She refuses to tell me a single thing off her \"huge list of awful features\" she has of me and ends up slamming the door in my face.\n\nTLDR: I was friends with a girl, now she says \"I am the worst person alive.\"",

For one, because I still think he’s a good dad and want him involved with our son, obviously. \nAnd for two, because I have to work a lot more now to be able to afford living on my own and supporting myself and my son while paying rent/car/bills. My ex and I have similar incomes so neither of us pay child support, though he recently got a new job and makes significantly more than I do, I believe. \n\nAnyway, him and his girlfriend are pushing for our son to be in preschool, which I agree would be good for him. \nHowever, I’m doing this by myself while working full time and going to school full time. Not only do I not have the time to work with preschool schedules (middle of the day Tues&amp;Thurs) which are the same days I have class, but I also don’t want to sacrifice the time I have with my son right now. (Not to say preschool isn’t important I just already miss him due to the 50/50 schedule, work, and college)\nI completely acknowledge those might be selfish reasons, but I seriously don’t know how I would bring/pick him up to preschool while I’m working... I work an hour away. My family helps watch him while I work but I bring him to them, as my parents don’t drive. So they couldn’t help me with this. \n\nMy thoughts are he will be in kindergarten this fall already. I will be done with school then. My schedule will be a lot more open, I should be able to work less as I’ll be making more, and can better work with the school schedule. \nI’ve spoken to his dad about my concerns/issues, and he says I’m being a bad parent and how could I not want our son in preschool? I just don’t know how I would do it...\n\nSo AITA?",

He created a fake Insta account messaging her telling her how gorgeous she is, etc. Note, this is not the first time this happened. So I confront him, he denies it, I have proof, he lies, I tell him he has to leave, he does. A few days pass and we talk about what happened; he said he had been suppressing stuff that made him unhappy. Well, this is the SAME reason he reached out to a girl the first time. At this point, I am SO mad that he would throw away our relationship over simply not coming to me and communicating “Hey, my feelings are hurt over X, Y and Z.” and then we can talk, fix it and be happy again. I am willing to work through this and make us work again. He says he needs his time.\n\nWe met up after a 1.5 weeks, he says the same thing; he needs more time to figure himself out. So I ask him upfront, are there any other girls in the picture? He tells me straight up, no. He isn’t interested, doesn’t want anything to do with girls, just wants to be alone and figure himself out. He asks me for another week of time and asks me to wait for him. I oblige. Monday rolls around, he texts me wanting to get back together. He makes plans to pack up his stuff (he’s been staying at a friend’s who’s lease is up March 1st) and come home today.\n\nDuring our time apart, through mutual friends, I saw him drunk at a club. So I tell him I need to know if anything happened. He said yes, he had a one night stand. I am devastated. We had been apart for less than 2 weeks when he hooked up with a girl during the extra week that HE requested while asking me to wait for him. At this point, I am broken and furious. I tell him he can’t come back and I don’t want to work things out. He tells me he’s moving back in anyway. I ask him to move in with his parents which would be free and he refuses. He says he can’t afford two rents for his own place and he refuses to pay for a place that he can’t live in. I am crushed; all I want is to move forward with my life and be able to get over him but I can’t do that when I have to see him every day for the next 6 months. I’m on student loans so I can’t afford the rent alone. So here he is, he cheats on me, asks me to wait for him, goes and has a one night stand, and then still gets to come back home? He gets to have his cake and eat it too. I feel like I’m being manipulated and controlled in his forcing me to live with him after all of this. So tonight I want to revisit the idea of him moving back in with his parents. Maybe I can talk to the complex about moving into a smaller apartment so the rent is less for us both. So AITA for asking him to move back in with his parents and still pay his half of the rent because this is his fuck up and he is legally obligated to pay?",

After seeing doctors and dentists, I finally landed at an oral surgeon’s office who took an X-ray and found my wisdom teeth were technically impacted but actively growing at the wrong angle. The reason I was experiencing numbness is because the my teeth are pressing down on a nerve, and surgery will be necessary to prevent possible permanent damage. I scheduled my surgery to land specifically on spring break for my school. Pretty much all of my professors this semester take off points for missing class, so missing an entire week was entirely out of the question for something I’m paying $21K for. This was in December.\n\nI asked my boyfriend immediately afterwards if he would be able to watch me for my surgery. He’s ending trade school so we planned ahead to make sure he would be free during the time I went for my surgery. Everything fit perfectly and we confirmed this was the plan. \n\nThis all changed about three weeks ago, when he got a call from a possible employer who was demanding that he start training on the same day of my surgery. My boyfriend asked if he could delay until the day after and explained the situation, but the employer basically brushed him off and said “she knows it’s a job right?” \n\nThat annoyed me immensely, seeing as this surgery is necessary and I’m not allowed to be by myself, but whatever. We had a heated discussion about it and I told him that if he can’t do it to let me know NOW so I can arrange a “baby sitter” as soon as possible. He kinda went back and forth on it and then decided that he doesn’t want to work with this specific company and that he’ll bring me for my surgery. Okay, cool, I can relax. \n\nToday(less than a week before my surgery), he tells me he can’t take me to my surgery. We get into a huge argument and he says he wants to go to the interview so that it can be on his resume for future employers to look at it. I’m pissed because I can’t find anybody to take me, everyone I know is busy. The paperwork specifically says I’m not allowed to leave the center by myself because I’ll be under the influence; someone has to check me out, so I can’t even get an Uber. He says I should consider his employment, but I don’t think any future employer is going to care that he got a job interview and trained for one day then quit. In fact, I think this shows a lack of commitment. \n\nI feel super guilty because I don’t want to say he can’t go to his interview but now I have to ask a friend to take the day off last minute.

We saw and approached two attractive women in their late 20's, one it turns out was an actress on a TV show (not famous, but whatever) and the other an artist. \n\nWe all had a flirty, fun convo with them for maybe 10-15 minutes. After everyone finished their respective drinks I asked them if they wanted to continue on together and join us for a cocktail at a place a few minutes away. They happily agreed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe new place was quite crowded and it was hard to find a table to sit at. Once we find one, I have to head back to the bar to get drinks as there is no table service. I take everyone's order and pay for a round of cocktails, since its a pay as you guy type of system, and walk the tray of libations back to the table.\n\nAfter a few minutes of chatting,  both ladies casually mention that they have boyfriends that they live with. As any person knows, this sort of info is disappointing to hear after you've invested time into someone you are interested in, but life goes on. We continue conversing about this and that and the mood is generally pretty good, although the convo is losing a bit of luster as time goes on.\n\nI was just finishing my drink and they were about 3/4 through theirs, and they announce that they are going to go for a cigarette in a minute. I suggest that they order the next round on their way out from the bar to the street so the bartender can make the drinks while they smoke, and save everyone a few minutes of waiting. They look at each other and think it's a joke for some reason, and give a sassy, tongue in cheek answer of \"if you want a drink, you know how to do it.\"\n\nI smile, and ask again, \"yeah, but seriously, I'd love to get another one of these. It's your round, after all, and you are going right by the bartender.\" They seem dumbfounded by this and again look at each other like I'm crazy for asking.\n\n\"No, that's not how it works,\" they say again sort of devilishly smiling. \"Nice try though!\" They head out for their cigarette. My buddy also announces he has to pee, and heads off. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this point I feel a bit like I've been taken advantage of. Call me crazy, but when I'm with friends, we will all take turns buying rounds. I'm happy to buy a gal a drink as part of the little ritual, but these two always had boyfriends. So they weren't going into it as part of the ritual, it was always a platonic type of situation for them in their minds. So why would they be exempt from buying a round after having one bought for them?  \n  \n\nThis is the AITA moment of truth. When they are outside I grab both their drinks and finish them. It's a rash decision, and one that obviously flaunts all norms of social courtesy, but in my mind it's acceptable and fitting. They broke the social code of offering to reciprocate, and in a fairly rude and dismissive manner. They seemed to have a level of entitlement that I didn't appreciate. And I had no interest in seeing them again. So fuck it, I'm going to drink the drinks I paid for.\n\nWhen they come back in and see that their glasses are only comprised of ice and a straw, the reaction is one of anger and disgust. They ask why I would do that and I tell them that I bought the drinks and they had no interest in buying the next round, so take it for what it is. A few choice words are thrown my way and they grab their stuff and hastily leave. \n\nMy buddy, just back from the toilet, watches all this unfold and has no idea what has happened. When I explain to him he thinks it's all crazy, but laughs, and we continue on.   \n\n\nSo yeah, I think there is some asshole behavior on my part, but it only came out as a response to what I saw as assholish behavior.

But it's the same during the weekends and it was the same even when we went for 2-week holidays - my husband refused to feed our baby at night at all &amp; he only got up with him once and bragged the whole day about how tired he is.\n\nI'm also a bit frustrated by the fact that during the weekends or evening when we are both at home, I'm still the one who is doing most work with the baby and around the house - it seems to me that it never happens that I relax, while my husband is taking care of the house or of the baby. The opposite (I'm doing stuff and he is relaxing) is happening all the time. \n\nWe talked about that I feel he is not thanking me enough for being sleep-deprived and letting him relax. E.g. he almost never thanks me in the morning when he sleeps in the guest room. We also talked about the fact that he feels I'm not appreciating him enough for working full-time and providing for the family &amp; I don't thank him enough when he helps me with the kid. He complained that I often say that his help is not much compared with what I'm doing. I must say that he has a point in this, but it comes from my frustrations described above.\n\nAbout 3 weeks ago, I was sick and had a bad cough. Everytime I coughed, our baby woke up and started to cry. My husband agreed that I can sleep in the guest room. First time since our baby was at home, I slept for 9 hours straight.\n\nI thanked my husband in the morning. He told me it was very difficult for him. In the evening I approached and I told him \"Thank you so much for taking care of our boy during the night.\" He seemed very happy that I thanked him. After that I told \"Now you can appreciate more what I do every night\". He looked at me as if I hurt him badly. He told me he though I'm finally thanking him and appreciating him, but I just talked about the fact how good I am.\n\nHe said it will be difficult for him to overcome how I hurt him.\n\n3 weeks later, and yesterday he told me he still can't believe me I'm being honest when I thank him for something, and that what I said 3 weeks ago hurt him very much.\n\nTL;DR: Husband never takes care of the baby during the night or in the morning. When he did for the first time when I was sick, I thanked him and said \"Now you can appreciate more what I do every night\".",

		"story": "So first off, I'm using the word ex, but we never defined a relationship. It started out as friend with benefits and then the lines kind of blurred but we never took the next step. We had an amazing run in the beginning, but in the end there was a lot friction, hurt feelings, I noticed my personality changing in a way I didn't like at all (e.g. I started snapping at minor things while compromising on things that I shouldn't have) and when I couldn't take it anymore I told him we shouldn't see eachother anymore. I later reached out again to tell him that once our emotions have cooled down, I was open to try and work things out, to see if we could get our friendship back at least (I'm aware of how naive that sounds, but we honestly used to be great together and I wasn't ready to completely give up on that at that point in time). \nThat was about ten months ago. A couple weeks back he messaged me and we caught up on eachother's lives a bit. I gave him about a week of just chit chat to get accustomed to eachother again and things actually went pretty good until I told him that I'd like to actually talk about what went wrong last time, because I don't see this going anywhere unless we learn from our mistakes back then. He pretty much immediately shot me down, telling me that he's happy that I'm doing well but messaging me was a mistake and we shouldn't continue.\nTo get to the point of this AITA: he works at a really cool place that I never went to during the past ten months, out  of respect for his 'territory'. However during the time after he contacted me again, when we were exchanging pleasant chit chat, I made plans to got to an event there with some friends and last night we went there and had a great time. I didn't expect to actually see much of him, he doesn't work in the service area but more behind the scenes, but we did come across eachother a couple of time during which he either ignored me or honestly didn't notice me (I doubt that though, not noticing four people that you know just a couple of feet away from you seems a bit implausible to me). So if I judge the situation correctly, my presence did make him uncomfortable. And even after all that happened between us, part of me really wouldn't like him to come into work every day dreading to be confronted with memories and feelings he'd rather not deal with (by seeing me, I'm not planning any kind of active confrontations). Another part of me thinks that he needs to get his head out of his ass and actually deal with his issues. Regardless, I would really like to go to more events at that location, simply because it's honestly that amazing and unique.\n\nAITA if I decide to hang out at my ex's workplace more often?",

(She was constantly making up extravagant stories of her past and was really rude to her parents that she still lived with.) I was at a really vulnerable part in my life and decided to stay her friend because she was an escape from my shitty life. \n\nAnyways, I introduce her to my friends since she was new to the area. After Haley got close to them she turned them all on me. She constantly fed them lies until they didn’t like me anymore.\n\nI cut Haley out of my life immediately and figured it was good that she helped me figure out who my fake friends were. She showed up at my house unannounced a couple times begging me to be her friend again but I always had my sister answer the door because I thought I’d punch her if I answered. \n\nI was a lonely mess after all of this, convinced that everyone hated me. Haley really hurt me. I did some soul searching that year while I was alone. I realized I was so full of hate towards her that it was only bringing me down and I needed to forgive her for my own mental health. \n\nI messaged her saying that there was no hard feelings and I hoped she was doing okay. She insisted that we hang out and told me she did some soul searching too and she changed. Me being lonely, I said yes. \n\nWhen I met Haley’s boyfriend, Zack,  I realized I already knew him from middle school. Zack and I got along really well, better than Haley and I did and we became closer friends. He constantly confided in me that he wanted to break up with Haley every day. And Haley told me the same thing about Zack. They had a seriously fucked up relationship where they were constantly screaming at each other. \n\nAnyways they had an extra ticket to this music festival and begged me to go. Haley told me that she didn’t wanna go alone with Zack cause she’d be annoyed the whole time and Zack told me the same thing about Haley.  I figured a free ticket is a free ticket and I went. \n\nAfter the concert we were all really drunk. We went back to the hotel room and Haley insisted that we have a threesome. We were all down and went for it. Although Zack was really hot, I wasn’t that into Haley so I was really uncomfortable then Haley got uncomfortable too because her boyfriend was kinda just fucking me in front of her. She told him to stop, they starting having sex again, I felt weird and left the hotel room. \n\nZack came and found me after about 30 minutes and we walked to the parking garage. Anyways we had sex. \n\nI feel like Haley deserved what she got and I wouldn’t have had sex with Zack if they didn’t insist on having a threesome in the first place. I never planned on having sex with Zack before that moment. \n\nZack and I decided to keep that night a secret. After a week I felt guilty and told Haley. She didn’t believe me, stole my vape I left at her house and a bunch of my clothes. \n\nIt’s a year later and I still get texts from people telling me that Haley said I had sex with their boyfriend even though I didn’t. People from my home town think I have sex with anyone I meet and that I have STDs because of the rumors she’s made up about me. \n\nSo am I the asshole for having sex with Zack? ",

However, our tiny little back garden has become a dumping ground for the kids footballs and toys (as well as rubbish). Initially it was one football that would get blown into the back and it'd sit there until the kids came back to get it. This wasn't an issue for us at first.\n\nOver time though, we have ended up with a collection of 6 footballs in our back. I've spoken to the parents about it because I've walked out of my back door a few times and fell over a ball. Right in front of my back door is a 5 foot brick wall and I almost cracked my head against it one night from tripping on a ball. Again, this has been brought up with the parents and the response is generally the same: \"kids, eh?\". \n\nOn top of the kids toys, I'm also removing other peoples rubbish from our back each day, as well as cigarette ends too. We can't do much out the back because our neighbours like to hang stuff over our fence and I've seen my neighbour shoving our property away from the fence so she can hang things on it (brushes, mops, mop buckets, towels etc).\n\nOur garden has become a dumping ground and I'm wondering if I would be an asshole for throwing the balls away.

Before uni I dated another guy for about 7 months who I'll call Jay, we broke up because he was always travelling and it was hard to maintain long distance so it was better to be friends. \n\nLately I've been going through a lot of personal stuff; I've battled with anxiety since I was young and its been really kicking into high gear lately, my family is planning a big move that will either result in an excruciating commute to school or me having to live on campus or find a roommate, I just lost a friend of 7 years due to a major falling out and I don't really have anyone else besides my current bf and my ex. \n\nMy bf Ben has a really intense major and works on the weekends. He's usually the first person that I go to when I need to vent or talk things through, but he's super busy with work and studying so I don't want to bother him. Especially right now because we have midterm exams. My ex Jay is really busy as well, he works in music and is constantly travelling. We don't even see each other as exes, we really just see each other as long time friends. I usually only confide in him if Ben is busy and can't reply for a while.  \n\nLately Ben has been more distant than usual, because of exams and studying or whatnot. He cancelled our scheduled datenight to study and doesn't text as much except to hear about my day and say goodnight (which I'm not angry about, I understand he has to study and he still makes sure to talk to me at least a little every night). I needed to talk about some stuff, just a mini rant to get things off my chest. I didn't want to bother Ben while he was studying, so I texted Jay instead. I ranted to him and I felt better. Later during our usual \"how was your day\" convo, I told Ben that I was having a rough day but I felt better after talking to Jay. This made him upset, and he said I could've come to him if I was upset, and I should've before talking to Jay. I said I didn't want to interrupt his studying and said I would go to him first next time. We didn't get into a huge argument about it, he's a really chill guy and we just carried on with our convo for a little bit before he went to bed. \n\nThe way I see it is both of them are super busy, but Ben doesn't reply until the evening and Jay replies almost instantly, and I don't want to be stewing over something all day when I can get it off my chest that moment. They're also different in how they react: Jay asks questions and gives advice, while Ben just says \"that sucks, just go relax.\" I usually always text Ben first and only text Jay if I don't get a reply, but this time I just skipped the middleman. The only reason was really because I didn't want to bother Ben and I knew I would get actual responses from Jay instead of \"sleep it off.\" \n\nAITA for confiding in my ex before my boyfriend?",

Sometimes she likes to invite us out to eat and always says “if you’re invited, you’re not paying.” My family doesn’t really go out, except maybe ordering pizzas once a week. So eating out isn’t really in our budget. Other things, like special crafts or classes that my mom wants to do, she will pay for.

		"story": "So this is not my usual account, as I don't want people to know that my marriage is on the rocks.  I'd like to start by giving you a rundown of our history so far, so you can get a general idea of what each of us are dealing with. This will be long. TL;DR at bottom.\n\nMy husband and I have been married just over 5 years. What I didn't know when we got married was that my husband had a gambling issue. He hid it very well when we were dating and for a good few months after we got married, but then as we started living together there were aspects that didn't add up. Less than a year into the marriage he admitted that he had a gambling issue.\n\nMy husband is paid weekly, and his pay is fairly high compared to my own. He earns about 75k per year, whereas I earn about 60k now. To compound on the pay gap, I was a student when we first met (husband is a lot older), and worked restaurant jobs during the first two years of marriage. Then I moved onto an admin job, and now I am working in my field of choice. It is entirely fair to say that my husband has consistently earned more than me. I estimate that if I had brought in about 110k over the last 5 years, my husband had earned around 200k or a little more.\n\nMy issue is that my husband had never, not once, missed a week of gambling. Each payday he is in a pub or at the casino, gambling. The smallest amount from memory is about $200.00 per week. When he is feeling especially addicted, he will literally blow his entire week's wage on pokie machines, and then ask me for part of my wages too. This has happened more times than I can count. \n\nDuring our marriage, I have managed to compile approximately $30k in personal loan debts and $42k for a car loan. He has asked money from every member of his family, to the point they will no longer lend him money. He gambles every tax return away. He has gambled about $8k of personal loan debts. We have since sold the car, so I have about 30k in debts owing in my name.\n\nI interpret this to mean that my husband is not bringing in enough money into the relationship, regardless of how much he is earning, as he is spending a significant chunk on gambling. \n\nMeanwhile, I generally try to scrimp. I cut my hair once a year, I never do my nails, I don't buy clothes unless I absolutely need it. I feel that even if I have earned less, I have brought into the relationship as much, or arguably even more, than my husband. \n\nMy husband does not agree. He is adamant that he could not have spent as much as I say he has. We fight over money every payday. I was patient and kind the first year or so, until my personality started getting ugly, and frankly abusive, towards my husband. In my defense, I genuinely have never shouted at another person in my life. My husband is the only person I lose my temper with. We are now at the point where I will be screaming all sorts of abuses at him at the top of my lungs. I feel like if I don't, I will die or implode from stress.\n\nI am now at a point where I inform him on almost a weekly basis that I will be leaving him. He is now immune to my threats, understandably, but it's like an addiction I cannot stop. My husband now informs me that I am not 'loyal' for saying such things. That we should be sticking it out through thick and thin, and he is hurt that I would say such things.\n\nLast week we agreed that each of us would bring in an equal amount into the relationship, and the rest of our money we would spend as we please, whether we are gambling or doing our hair. He was good last week. However, this week, he claims not to have received his wage, that their system had been down, and he would give me the money when he received it. He was supposed to have been paid on Wednesday. It is now Thursday night, and he says he will receive it tomorrow. He asked to lend me $50, he just wanted a drink at the pub, he will pay me back tomorrow along with our fixed amount. I agreed. An hour later he called me and asked me to lend him another 100. He will pay me back tomorrow, he says. Through 5 years of his working at this company, his pay has been delayed once. I therefore informed him that I find this hard to believe, and if he showed me his bank account and confirmed that he had not received his wage, I will give him the 100. He flat out refuses and asks me why I cannot wait until tomorrow, if I just wait, I will know. I once again blew my top and screamed at him. \n\nI now know that because I screamed at him, he will be upset, and feel justified in spending everything he has and blame me because I could not wait one day.\n\nAITA for 1. asking my husband to show me his bank account in the first place and 2. losing my temper when he didn't?\n\n(I think people will want to know this - why do I keep giving him money? He will not stop asking until I give it to him. If I lock myself in a room at midnight so I can sleep for work the next day, he will bang on the door until I open it and give him money. He has hacked into my bank account a few times to take my money without my consent.)\n\nTL;DR: husband has been gambling significant amounts of money since early on in our 5 year marriage. I became suspicious that he was lying to me today and asked him to show me his bank account as proof, and screamed at him when he wouldn't.",

This left me with abandonment issues, especially as her parents had always shown blatant favouritism towards my sister and she had been planning to take my sister with her when she left.\n\nAfter my mother left my dad reached out to his sister (aunt), her husband (uncle) and their kids (cousin 1 and 2), and we started to see them more regularly. We hadn’t spent much time with them before, which aunt told my dad was because they never liked my mother.\n\nWe never had much in common and it always felt a bit forced spending time with them now. Uncle is very controlling and always made me feel a bit uncomfortable. I refused to hug him once and he followed my around trying to force me to, and told me I was being disrespectful. He’s also intimidated me before when my dad wasn’t around, telling me I won’t get on in life if I’m not more likeable.\n\nCousins have got worse over the years, and last time they visited us they wanted to spend the whole time with my sister, and tried to leave me and my boyfriend on a shopping trip when we driven them into town, so they could just hang out with my sister. They even tricked her into going on a walk with them without me. After they left my sister told me that they had been badmouthing me and my dad, saying that I would be a bad mother and that I was too affectionate with my boyfriend.\n\nAunt doesn’t say much and likes to pretend her family is perfect, but is really judgemental of us.\n\nA few weeks ago my aunt called my dad (they talk every week) and during the conversation mentioned that he should come and visit sometime, and that my sister (who’s just finished university) would be welcome to move in with them and look for a job there. She didn’t mention me once.\n\nAfter my dad told me that I got really upset and ended up unfriending them all on facebook. I haven’t spoken to any of them since. I feel like I’m being really petty and they haven’t actually done anything wrong, but they’ve still really hurt me with their actions. I also don’t want to cause any issues with them for my dad, and I just know that they’re going to use my behaviour against him.\n\nSo reddit, should I keep ignoring them and cut them out of my life completely or am I being an asshole and should just suck it up for the sake of my family?",

Her face lights up and she can’t stop smiling and holding my hand whenever I’m around.\n\nHowever, I know that I’m the favorite and she treats the rest of her grandchildren less favorably. I’m the oldest daughter of her oldest son, so I get the best treatment (it would have been even more extreme if I was born male). My sister sort of counts since she’s also from my dad. My older male cousins don’t count since they’re from my aunt and my younger female cousin doesn’t count because my uncle adopted her. She’s never come out and say it, but everybody can tell because she never gives the same attention to my sister and cousins.

My grandpa died when my dad was very young and left my grandma with young children in a foreign country with no education or English-speaking skills. She used verbal and physical abuse to corral my dad and his siblings into order, and she’d manipulate them against each other. She constantly unfavorably compared the siblings to my dad, and would punish my dad for their infractions. They still resent my dad for how my grandma treated them, while my dad still gets the brunt of her anger.\n\nShe’s very old at this point (100+) and really should have assisted living, but refuses a caretaker or retirement home. My parents took her in at one point, but she cried to my aunts and uncles about how my parents were abusing her, and there was a huge family fight. She’s never apologized about it. The last time I saw her at a family event, she was ranting about my dad so horribly that my uncle and I literally wheeled her out to the car mid-tirade. \n\nI’m extremely close to my parents and sister and hate the way she treats them. I mentioned to someone that I never want to see her again. They were shocked that someone who is so close to her family wouldn’t feel the same way about her grandma.

In the end, they turned my position into an unpaid one, and decided to fire me out of the blue. A big problem at this job was management. Things that were supposed to be done by someone else, often ended up being my job and often times ended up being done outside of work hours that I was never paid for. A lot of the people at this job were older than me, and had a lot of problems with technology. Which led to me offering a lot of tech advice, which while appreciated was always met with a snide comment or two about millennials. Like I said, I liked the job a lot though, and so I put up with it. \n\nIt’s been two months and no one has removed my name (misspelled btw because that’s how much they cared about me) from the company website. It still says that I work there and at which position. And even though my name isn’t exactly right online, it’s really unique for the area, and a simple google search brings up my Facebook/social media accounts. I’ve had people contact me asking about details about the workplace/etc. and every time I write back something like, “Actually, I don’t work there anymore. The company is just super behind on updating things and its social media.” Am I the asshole for not contacting the company and letting them know their mistake? I feel like I’m only going to get more and more people contacting me. ",

My brother's team starts to behind in goals, and the opponents and their coach seem to think this is a great opportunity to be crazily disrespectful, making dirty fouls, clapping loudly whenever our team misses a pass, insulting the crowd and making fun of my little brother's team (\"hey let's try and get that 10 goal lead\"). Things are clearly heating up, and I'm slowly getting mad and excited, even though I still remain quiet.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe game ends, my mom and I are heading out, while my father waits inside gymnasium for my brother. The enemy team's players come out: they're loud, obnoxious, and complaining about a lack of fair-play from our team. I'm out of the car, while my mom's sitting in it. I overhear them trashtalk my club one too many times, and it makes my blood boil. I open the car's door and tell my mom I'm going to see them. I call the other team's coach, and tell him that I reckon he's being pretty arrogant for a coach that didn't see his team win a single game the year prior, and lose every week-end by 40 to 10. By the time I end my sentence, my mom has jumped out of the car, stepped in and is insulting the coach. I know she's short-tempered and really hot-headed, so I'm considering holding her back ; but the coach is already getting inside his car. I turn around and start walking towards our car, certain my mom is right behind me, but after a few steps I hear them both still arguing. When I look back, my mom has opened the coach's car, and she's almost stepped in yelling at his face. I'm pretty paralysed at this point, still very stirred up. I don't move until a few seconds later, when my mom finally comes back to the car, sits in and lets out a sigh.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know what I did probably wasn't the right nor best thing to do, but I just felt like this time I wouldn't let it go ; but I also realise that was she did was very wrong, and that the guy could've hit her. She then asks me that I don't tell my father, as he'd be really angry at her for what she did, because it could've turned out real bad for her. But I also don't want her to do that again, when noone else will be by her side to help her if it turns bitter.

I told him I had some cards in my attic somewhere and that I can bring a few decks to play yesterday. I knew that his gf is a little controlling about what he does sometimes so I even asked him if he's sure that he wants me to bring my cards. So I spent like 2 hours rummaging through my attic for my cards and brought them to the event. \n\nAfter we play a few rounds of another game, I ask him if my friend wants to play Magic now. Before my friend can answer, his girlfriend just interjects that he's not going to be playing anything but the game we're currently playing. So I told her we already made plans to say and asked her \"what do you mean he's not playing?\". She ignored what I asked and just repeated that he's not playing and \" I don't care if we already made plans\". At that point I was a little more than pissed and I started yelling that she can't just tell me that my friend's not playing in his place and that she's really disrespecting me. She just ignored everything I said and started telling the people around us that I have anger issues and that everyone else should be careful of this guy(referring to me). \n\nI got really pissed at that moment so I started packing my things up and got ready to leave but I was stopped by Kevin. He was nice enough to ask me if I still wanted to play but I just said \"I'm pretty upset and it's probably better if we don't play\". Then I just left with another group of friends. \n\nBy the way, I'm a straight guy, so it was purely platonic intentions.\n\nAnyways, Kevin's gf apologized to me today about telling everyone else that I have anger issues, but I'm pretty sure that it's only because some other people I knew from the bar told me that Kevin told her to apologize to me.

She had a child with him and my half-brother is now 5. She ultimately moved to Seattle to get away from him. She was in Seattle for less than a year before her twin sister, and later her mom, kicked her out for allegedly being too difficult to live with. I offered her to move in with me so she can start fresh, get a job, save for a car and ultimately get her own place for her and my brother.

		"story": "This story has a little bit of character setup before getting to “the incident”. A fwb of mine had moderate to severe alcoholism coupled with depression and anxiety. She had to have a drink first thing in the AM and first thing when she came back from the university and nursed a buzz almost all day. She knew she had a problem and in her words was “waiting for some incident to give her a wake up call.” \n\nHer main job was a bar tending gig back in her home town 2 hours away on the weekends. 3 weeks straight I got snaps every night of the weekend of her driving drunk. Since she was mixing her anxiety and depression meds with alcohol, she blacked out pretty much after 2 drinks. She doesn’t remember our first 5 dates because of this and we both are speculating the only reason she blacked out so easily for a period of a few months when she went on new meds.\n\nOn top of all this, she was a “runner.” She’d be in a group of friends and just decide to take off. Not in a sprint, but casually say, “I have to go to the bathroom” and then leave the bar for us to try and track her down. This happened 3 times when I was with her.\n\nHer mentioning she needed a wake up call wasn’t too alarming to me. Loads of college students drink and I didn’t take her seriously about being an alcoholic. After the month of drunk driving snaps is when I realized this could end poorly.\n\nThe incident. \n\nOn one of the weekends she wasn’t scheduled to work, we went out for a late dinner with a mutual friend. She had been drinking all day and had 2 drinks at the restaurant when she became unresponsive and passed out in her seat in the restaurant around 9:30 or so. She had never passed out before. Blacked out-many times, but she didn’t sound inebriated or display any sign of drunkenness whatsoever in any of those situations. We were both pretty fucking embarrassed and I was a smidge angry to have to drag a passed out women from restaurant. The mutual friend that I had dinner with also was aware of my fwb’s drinking problems and that she was in a downward spiral. In jest, one of us had mentioned,\n\n“We should just drop her ass off in detox for alcohol poisoning so she can finally have her god damn wake up call. She wont remember the last 8 hours of today anyways. She will probably think a stranger dropped her off and would be none the wiser.” \n\nSo thats exactly what we did. I left and went home. She came to and sobered up there, and had no idea how she got there, or any recollections of the evening. I lied to her and said we got dinner and a few drinks, and then she ran off as she was prone to and we couldn’t find her. A week later or so, she got her hospital bill which was a few grand she couldn’t afford. I stopped seeing around this time, so I’m not sure if “she had her wake up call or not.” \n\nTLDR: dropped an alcoholic off at detox to give them a wake up call when I could have easily just taken care of them at home myself.",

		"story": "Throwaway since my entire household uses reddit. Sorry, kind of long.\n\nOn Christmas day, one of the roommates offered everyone in the house some of his opened bottle of wine. It was gone by that night. \n\nI had received a different bottle of wine as a Christmas gift from my mom. I left it on the table for the next few days, intending to put it away, but it kept slipping my mind. It was one of those Game of Thrones bottles with a pretty cool label. Game of Thrones is a big deal in our house, and I had wanted to open it for the premiere. \n\nI came home from work Friday to find it opened and half drank. Pretty bummed, I wanted to know who did it so I could explain that it had been mine. When I found out, I texted him and just let him know what was up - that was mine and had been a gift. He immediately replied that it was the wine our other roommate had offered to him before it was offered to me. I explained that no, that bottle was gone. The one he was drinking tonight was mine. I got no reply. \n\nThe next day I was busy and really only saw him in passing. On Sunday afternoon when I saw him again, I asked if he'd be willing to replace the bottle or if I was just eating the loss. He got a little annoyed and said people drink his stuff all the time and he never asks for it to be replaced. Now, there is one person in this house who drinks other people's alcohol on a regular basis and it's not either one of us. And he knows that. I said I only cared because it was a Christmas gift that I had a plan for, then walked off to my room, deciding not to pursue it further at that point. I realized it was partially my fault for leaving it out. As I entered my room and pushed the door closed it shut rather forcefully. Totally unintentional, I swear. I wasn't really feeling more than disappointed and a little frustrated at this point, and I haven't intentionally slammed a door in anger since I was a kid. \n\nWe ran into each other a little bit later and he asked, \"You do understand it was a mistake, right?\" I said a bit tersely \"yeah, but you haven't even apologized for it.\" He started raising his voice at me at this point, and I definitely started to raise mine back in reflex. He was saying a lot about how it matters to him when people drink his beers but he never asks for it back or an apology. He kept saying it was a mistake, and I said I agreed that I shouldn't have left it out but once he realized it was mine instead of the other bottle that an apology would be warranted. That's when he screamed at me that he didn't make any mistake, but rather that I did. His reasoning was that I should have known that he would think it was the other bottle (the one opened, drank by all, and emptied 3 days prior) and open it and drink it, and my refusal to reconcile with my mistake was not his problem. \n\nIt was at this point that I got confused and dropped my raised tone. I said that made no sense. How could I have known that he would think that? He kept yelling, yelled that I was too emotional, then walked off. Now unfortunately he is also the landlord's son. He told me he wanted me out in 30 days. I thought it was just something said in anger and decided to let him cool off. I waited until I was about to go to bed that night and apologized for getting so heated and making him upset, because I was. I can be a little reactionary when I feel people getting upset with me and that's what happened here. My emotions were especially out of wack because I was/am stil dealing with being sexually assaulted on Christmas eve. Not an excuse for getting heated and I will own up to that, but it explains it a little. I never wanted a blow out fight over this, just a \"shit, sorry dude\" at minimum. Regardless, he told me my apology means jack shit to him, and that anybody willing to \"come at him\" in his own house like that would be willing to do it again. He said he lets us live here out of the kindness of his own heart and I abused that.\n\nHe served me with a notice on New Year's Eve in front of a roommate and a party guest. Now I'm being kicked out of my house over wanting an apology for a bottle of wine. Am I the asshole?",

		"story": "Tldr; friend lives with us for cheap rent, reacted furiously to my request to give my long distance wife and I a day to ourselves in our home and asked that we do not do so again. \n\nI'll try to keep it to the point.\n\nMy wife and I bought a house last year. We live in a HCOL area so this was a big deal for us, a very significant part of our lives. Prior to that we had each been saving and living in random shared accommodation for years, so a huge motivation for us to buy was to have our own space together.\n\nThe property we got is somewhere we hope to one day start a family and so it is more than we need for two people. We considered getting a lodger and one of my best friends (let's call them J) was looking for somewhere at the same time. Despite being wary of ruining an important friendship through the friction of living together, we decided it made sense. This was the first time in my life that I was in a position like this and for reasons I can't really explain it was and I guess still is important to me that I was giving a friend a  good deal. We settled on offering J the room for 600 instead of 900.\n\nWe lived together like this with no problems for a while and then for work reasons my partner moved overseas. This means that we will see each other approximately 4 times a year for the next 3 years. I continued to live in the property with J for the next few months with no issues.\n\nThe first time my partner got time off work to visit was over Christmas. A few weeks before this we asked J if we could have the place to ourselves for a couple of days while my partner was here. His response did not seem particularly enthusiastic, but nor did I notice any particular resentment about it. J said he would work something out, and if necessary stay with his girlfriend. We did not discuss specifics such as dates and I was quite content that there were no problems.\n\nFast forward to the week before my wife got home and she wanted to confirm that it was still ok for us to have the place to ourselves so she sent a message with the dates we thought would be most convenient for J given the plans we knew he had over Christmas. His reply was very snippy and said he had not realised this was still a thing and it was not ideal to be unable to come home but that he would stay with his gf. We thought this was really weird but as he was away at the time we didn't have a chance to speak in person we just said thanks and left it at that.\n\nOver the next week J was very off with me, refusing to engage in conversation (messages) with me etc. This was out of character and definitely a consequence of simmering resentment that my wife and I didn't understand. Finally, my wife arrives home and we don't have much on our minds except each other and we have an amazing day spending our first Christmas together (not actually Christmas, just another day we chose to call that) as a married couple in our home that we had bought together (bonus: it was one of the best days of my life). As agreed J stayed with his girlfriend and we are grateful for this, despite being wary about his message and feeling that hanging over us. \n\nThe next day he sends a very hostile message asking us to do him a favour and next time my wife was visiting not to ask him not to be in the house he rents from us. I reply asking if that was everything that was bothering him and he confirmed there was nothing else. We suggested that we talk about it when he was home.\n\nHe arrives home and stays in his room for a couple of days (unprecedented behaviour for him) until eventually I ask him if he wants to talk. Basically, he said his problem was that it was inconvenient to him that we would ask him to be out of the house and that he found it mind blowing that we would think it was an acceptable request. He had run it past other people and they unanimously agreed with him.\n\nIn reply we were pretty firm that we didn't think it was an unreasonable request and that he should have said if he was unhappy so we could work something out that didn't inconvenience him. He said it was the general fact he couldn't come home that was inconvenient rather than the specifics. I know it's not really relevant, but for context his long term girlfriend lives reasonably close by and it's not unusual for him to stay with her. Obviously we would not have asked him to sleep on the streets or get a hotel or something. The conversation ended with an agreement that it came down to a difference of opinion about whether the request was normal and acceptable.\n\nThat was a couple of days ago now, but I have since been feeling rather bitter about the whole situation. I feel like a close friend of both of us should understand our need for some time alone in the brief spells we get together. I also feel extremely resentful about his bitterness towards us, and the fact he was speaking to other people about how unreasonable we are, despite the fact we give him a significant discount on his rent for being our friend.\n\nI have tried to be as unbiased as possible writing this, I hope I have managed to present an accurate picture because I am looking for honest feedback about whether my feelings are justified and whether I should set them out plainly to J.",

A few weeks back I learned that she retired and my hair has been getting pretty shaggy since then.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have a job interview tomorrow so I finally decided to find a new stylist. I went to my normal shop, sat in a new (to me) person's chair, and tried to explain what I wanted. I told her that I believed the sides were usually a 2.5-3 with the top longer because that's what I styled. I also said that I'd like to start with cleaning everything up and working down from there because I wanted to look good for my interview. I don't know where the miscommunication happened, but before I knew what was happening she popped on a 3 and did one long line right along the top of my head.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLong story short I sat there in silent rage as I lost all of my hair, paid, and walked out without leaving a tip.

Two friends of friends flew in before me and rented a car so they could go to the hotel first. I was picked up by my local friends and we had a great weekend in the city. On the day of departure, my local friends recommended I just ride with Jane and Kevin (the two aforementioned friends of friends) since they were on the way to the airport too. I agreed since it made sense for my local friends to go directly home and not waste time dropping me off if Jane and Kevin were going to the airport already. \nA few days later, I Venmo requested Jane and Kevin -and everyone else on the trip- food charges that we had eaten and split among the group. Kevin declined my request without any communication and sent back a request for gas. Now at this point I was a little confused since I had spoken to Jane (the one who had rented the car) and she had said gas wasn't an issue. The tank was only half empty when it was filled so with gas prices being around 3.50, I figured 20 bucks was the max that gas could cost - split among 3 would make it a little over 6 dollars. After declining my charge for food which was about 6 bucks, Kevin charged me an additional money for gas. I immediately declined the charge. Now several individuals who have been roped into this debacle are asking why I declined. Am I the asshole here? Is he? Both? Or is it just some miscommunication?",

This took a lot of work and set up.\n\nThe class itself was meant to critque my work. I got good reviews, great even, but the pictures of dead animals and vegetation made my classmate remark \"This seems more like horror porn.

Her project consisted of clay animations forming from nothing and was sort of a counterpoint to my \"Decay\" work. Just a bunch of stop motion clay forming people and houses.\n\nI told her that her art was lazy and took no risk. It was just a \"stamp\" art project meant for school. Generic and not interesting.

I said it’s healthy to be skeptical of things that are seemingly incorrect. (this may have been where I fucked up) \n\nWas I so quick to dismiss her beliefs that I hurt her feelings over it?

He's been making romantic advances on my roommate (including touching her ass), has called me hurtful names, and treats his roommate and everyone else horribly. We'll call him Mike (not his real name for privacy). \n\nWe recently found out that Mike is being discharged from the program--much to our (me, my roommate's, and two of our guy friends') relief.

However, Mike's case manager wishes to fight the discharge--not that the staff of the program will agree to it as they are tired of Mike's bullshit. \n\nDue to the mounting drama, her depression, and people spreading rumors  (Mike, and a few others most likely), my roommate cut herself for (presumably) the very first time.

In our case the \"authority figure\" would be staff. \n\nI want to tell the staff about this incident, but I also don't want to butt my head into business I should not be involved in (even though Mike has done hurtful things towards me as well but I have already informed the staff of that). The longer Mike is here, the more I feel my roommate will suffer and possibly cut herself even more, maybe even lash out at me or one of our guy friends if it gets to that extremity.

My parents weren't very supportive of this decision and said that they wouldn't help me financially to move up there. I took it upon myself to work a fast food job to save enough money to move, and I did. I finally moved up, got a job, live in my own apartment (that I pay for), have a girlfriend, financial security, etc. \n\nA few months go by and it's Christmas time, my parents are nice enough to buy me a train ticket to come down and visit for a week. It was a great time, I see my friends, family, and I have an overall fun time altogether. That is until Christmas rolls around. Everybody was getting gifts except me, which didn't really make me sad, it's all about being around family that makes me happy. Finally at the end, I get a gift from my Mom and Step-dad. I was a bit surprised because I wasn't really expecting a gift. I open it and it's a book, titled \"Manual to Manhood.\" Inside there were instructions on everything that makes a man a man. How to change a flat, how to put on deodorant, how to pick up women, etc. Everything was dumbed down into two pages each, and the information in there were things I already knew how to do. I was a bit upset at the gift because I felt like my parents didn't think I was doing a good job or *manly* enough, or knew how to do anything. I didn't get into an angry fit, but they saw that I was visibly upset and thought that it was ungrateful that I didn't like their gift. \n\nEventually once I got back to New York I ended up tossing it because there was really nothing I could do with it. \nWas I just overreacting asshole?",

I've never understood how anyone can enjoy it, having limited holidays per year, having to show up to a location or work remotely every day without fail. I remember as a child asking my dad when his summer holidays were and being confused/horrified that he didn't get any.\n\nThe funny thing is, I actually have a job I really enjoy.\n\nI'll get the part out of the way that I'm sure most people will call my an asshole for. I live in a country with strong labour laws, I have (for employment) very good annual leave/sick leave compared to the rest of the world. I have a job for a company that I believe is helping the world, I get a good wage and only have to work 40 hours a week. I enjoy what I do, I'm good at what I do, always get praise from management. My team is awesome and I'm good friends with a few of them, no working drama. Pretty sweet right?\n\nWell every day I still feel absolute dread that I have to wake up to an alarm. Realising that I'll be doing this for decades to come is horrifying to me. I've more than once thought about just killing myself to avoid it, not because I'm depressed, I'm not at all. We work so much of our lives and get so little time off in comparison. If I'm sick, or want to take a holiday, I have to inform my work, if I don't I get fired. If I quit my job I lose my house as I can't pay the mortgage. It doesn't help that I feel like I could do my weeks worth of work in about two days but I have to come in every day or I get fired (I have asked my manager for work from home days, that's really a no go and most jobs don't allow it, I've looked extensively). \n\nI legitimately stayed at University for three years longer than I should have just to get the four months off at the end of the year, I used to work multiple jobs during the year to save up enough so I wouldn't have to work over the four months off. That's pretty much impossible to do with a full time job, nobody wants someone who'll work less than 10 months a year.\n\nWhenever I share even the softest version of my view with people they freak the fuck out, talk about how I owe everything to the job, how I need to be a team player and just do it. When I tell people I'm strictly 9-5 and don't check emails or take calls out of hours they also freak out and tell me I'm letting my employer down. I keep this stuff to myself now.\n\nI wish I could be doing anything else. When I have time off I read books, go for walks, go for runs, try new hobbies, watch movies, do volunteer work (not forced to do so I enjoy it significantly more). \n\nSo, am I a huge asshole for hating the whole idea/structure of work?",

Due to a mixture of post break-up loneliness, depression, and alcoholism, I've let my sad dick take control of my brain and slept with her. I'm not even attracted to her, and the fact that I'm too ashamed to confide in my friends about this situation is telling, but I just find myself caving in out of shear boredom almost. I think she's even catching on to the fact that I prefer not to have her around my place while others are over, and only see her when I'm feeling down.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL/DR: Girl I had a one night stand with but carry little interest in still contacts me.

How do you think it will make the other party feel? \n\nNext I did some research...ok I binged that catfish show and lurked on reddit...\n\nThe next time it came up I shared how negatively catfishing affects peoples’ lives. She was so dismissive to that (cuz she thinks she can get away with it ?) \n\nThen she made plans to meet this guy. I told her to at least do a video chat first. So did another close friend that is in the know. But the catfish gets so shady whenever we talk about the situation. I couldn’t get a straight answer but it seems like she did do a video chat and got rejected. Last time I asked how things were going she said she didn’t know if they were still meeting.

I blew her off and was rude about it saying I would be over in a minute (we r neighbors basically) but never showed up.

Back in October 2018 we moved states and got an apartment with his childhood/best friend(M20s). Let's call him C. I've only met and sparsely spoke with C so most of my knowledge of him has been through my bf. Theyve been friends forever so I figured he'd be a decent dude.\n\nJump forward to us all living together. We have a kinda small 2 bed 1 bath apartment. My bf and I in one room and he in the other. The only downside is how small our kitchen is. There's hardly room for 2 people to be in there at once and we have like zero counterspace.\n\nAnyways, I soon realized that C is super fucking messy. Which I wouldn't really have a problem with if he cleaned up after himself like at all. Cause I'm a messy person too but I grew up in a household where if you made a mess, you cleaned it up as soon as you could. Common decency when living with other people right? \n\nThis situation happens almost everyday. Im usually the first up in the morning to drink coffee and read in peace. I also clean the kitchen almost every morning. And by that I mean: load the dishwasher, handwash pots and pans, wipe down the counters and stove top and sweep. It maybe takes 20 minutes. No big deal at all. That is until later that night C comes in and makes the biggest mess. I'm talking pots and pans left on the stove with burned food sitting in them, 10 different bottles of spices on the counters, burned food and stuff all over the stove stop and counters I just cleaned earlier. Plus half the sink is full. You get the picture.\n\nSo when the kitchen is like this and I want to make food or basically do anything, I literally have to clean all this shit up because our kitchen is that small.\n\nAfter the first month of this I was so done. My boyfriend could definitely tell how upset this made me and tried to do whatever he could to help. But what I want is C do be a damn adult and clean up after himself. Is that so much to ask for? Do I really have to ask him to clean his own messes? My bf and I do all the other cleaning in the apartment as well. We vacuum and clean the bathroom and take the garbage out.\n\nThis is turning into a rant but I wanted to give as much info as possible. Do you think I'm being unreasonable for wanting to live in a clean place? I'm so tired of cleaning up after him and it's come to the point where my bf literally has to tell him to clean but even then it's half assed and we clean again shortly after.\n\nWhat are your thoughts reddit?

Mine has become our main transportation for both of us and he's contributed 25% of the payment since we're using it only. I have no problem driving him around because he contributes to the payment, but his family is becoming an issue to me. For the record, I like his family, but they do not help him out in any way. His mother mainly loves to mooch for everything she can and never returns the favor. He's always bending over backwards to help her out and it's not been an issue, but it is now since we're using my car. \n\n   We always have to pick several members of his family up for any family events because hardly anyone has cars, which adds an extra 30 minute drive to the location. Last week his mother got dropped off at our work asking us to take her home after I had already told BF, \"No, I'm tired and want to go home already.\" So we had to drive an extra 20 minutes just to take her home after working an 11 hour shift. He says we have to because he pays part of my payment, but I feel like that doesn't cover his family's expenses and they're taking advantage of us. They never cover gas money or do anything for him/us. \n\n   I feel that if I still pay 75% of my payment on a car that's in my name then I should get the most say in where we go. I never had an issue when his car was working, but now I'm running the miles up on my car that I've put much more money into over the years than he has over the past few months. Also he's not on my insurance, so I have to do all the driving because he's not covered. We had a fight last night because I said I wasn't taking any family members anywhere else until they covered their expenses at least. I feel less like a part of the family and more of a taxi driver. He brought up the fact I help my family out when they need it, but I've always been compensated when I have and I feel as it's different because I've never seen a dime or any offer of helping us with anything from his side. \n\n  I've been told I'm being selfish because it's \"family\" but I feel like you still can't use people over and over again because you're related?

Usually this would be fine, but for a major extravert seeing people other than family only once a week isn't near enough. All the kids but my oldest brother and sister, (19 and 17), aren't allowed on social media, and can't talk to *anyone* we don't know online, no public discord servers, no chat on games, no Reddit, YouTube, steam forums, et cetera. They also have a rule of no dating until 18.\n\n I eventually just gave up on no game chat because I'm an extrovert and it's painful not being able to talk to people. Making other people happy, telling them jokes, making them laugh, it's what makes me happy. So I started chatting in game. \n\nSo usually I go to bed and read on a Kindle tablet for a bit, but one night it was late and I was too tired to read. I started watching YouTube, and I loved it. I loved interacting in the comments, making jokes, just watching YouTubers. This lead me to discord servers, Reddit, online freinds, and webtoon. Overall, I've been pretty responsible with what I veiw online. There have been multiple times where my parents almost found out, but I just denied it because I'm a compulsive liar and kind of a pussycat when it comes to owning up. \n\nWhat makes this even worse is that I want to become a creator, making animations for YouTube, and illustrating for webtoon, but my parents obviously have a rule against that. I have a messed up sense of self worth, based on how many people know *of* me but don't *know* me. I want to make a difference outside of my friend group you know?

But if she ever asks me if I like her, I'll have to turn her down, because my parents wouldn't approve of it.\n\nTo be honest, I actually want my parents to find out at this point, but I can't bring myself to do it.

I wouldn’t say I have a “line” to be crossed, so to speak, on any of the jokes made. Until I found out I did. A mutual friend that had been added to the group recently, one who it wouldn’t bother me in the slightest if I never heard from again, decided a few months ago it would be funny to send some footage of what could be described as a hostage situation with a drug cartel I’m assuming. They had a man tied up with a bag over his head and they were slicing into his torso with a knife. I’m talking like you can see the fat under his skin type slicing. Since this is Snapchat the video plays automatically when you open it so I had no choice whether I saw it or not. I’ll never get that image out of my head, this man was being tortured. So I pretty much said that if this is what the group chat was going to turn in to then they should let me know so I can leave, I would’ve preferred to have not seen that. It was met with some pretty heavy backlash, things like “you’re being a baby” “you have a weak stomach” things like that. I got in a big argument with everyone, it seemed *insane* to me that I was the one being looked at like an asshole and weak for saying I would leave the group over that and didn’t want to see it. My friends like to act like nothing bothers them or grosses them out (maybe it’s true, I don’t know), I don’t think they’re bad people. Whatever. It blew over, haven’t had anything like that since. Fast forward to yesterday and they were talking about some gross skin related stuff, which is more tame, but I still think is gross. A reasonable thing to find disgusting I think. So I literally just sent a picture of a grossed out face in response and it blew up again “what are you gonna leave the group? Does your tummy hurt?”. I explained that it’s not the same thing and we got in an argument that eventually ended. This all happened early in the morning, so when the member who sent the torture video before read the argument he sent the video **again** just to be an asshole. I acted like it didn’t bother me this time because I had already seen it, but I thought that was so disrespectful. Everyone else is acting like I’m the asshole for making a big deal out of not wanting to see things like that, but I think any normal person wouldn’t want to see videos like that.

He'll fight to the end. \n\nHerein lies the problem: I always knew he had a lot of stuff, he would talk about it but I didn't realize how bad it was. I found out how bad when I dropped of food and he couldn't get up out of bed to put it away himself. The kitchen sink doesn't drain, there was a water leak in the upstairs bath and now there is two inches of mold hanging from the downstairs bathroom ceiling, the bathroom likely hasn't been cleaned in years with shit all over the toilet. He doesn't take the garbage out and there's even mold on the egg shells. I ended up nauseous and bordering on an asthma attack after being in there for 2min. There are paths to get through the rooms but they are narrow - I'm sure a fire marshal would have a fit. I'm concerned about his basic hygiene at this point. When I saw all this it was 6:30pm and he admitted he hadn't been out of bed or eaten yet that day.\n\nWere he not dying, I wouldn't hesitate to call the county and get him help for the hoarding.  But since he is, which is more important: his mental health or what physical health he has left? A week in the hospital in December yeilded anxiety attacks from being separated from his stuff.  So, would I be the asshole for calling and getting him sent to a county home for the short remainder of his life? Or do I leave him to die in peace in his filth?",

I'm not here to shit on my dad. I mean, I hate what he has done and I resent him for it but I feel that getting mad at a mentally ill person is like getting mad at a hurricane or a flash flood for destroying your home. Pointless.\n\nMy sisters and I have tried on repeated occasions to help my dad and mom by confronting my dad, offering to find solutions and even committing time to cleaning up the mess in an attempt to take control of this difficult situation. Nothing has worked. I feel terrible for my 72 y'old mom who has basically resigned herself to waiting for my father to die before she can move on from the situation.\n\n**My older** brother told all of his friends about my dad and constantly complains to his girlfriend and therapist about how he was traumatized by my family. I hate him for doing this because he aired all of our private family bullshit. I mean, a therapist I can understand, but strangers? His therapist, or so he claims, told him to cut all of us out of his life. Which he did and has officially proclaimed to everyone how he has walked away from the situation and anyone who stays \"is a gaslit fool\" ... He attempts to maintain a connection with two of my sisters but I told him that I never want to see him again for ditching the rest of us with this problem.\n\n**My younger** brother was \"helping out\" by selling some of my dad's junk (old generators, a couple of cars, some paintings) and it added up to quite a lot after awhile. My dad might be crazy but he is fair. His deal was that we would always split the profits 50/50 after expenses. My brother on the other hand sold my dad's stuff, gave him money for what my dad paid for it and pocketed the rest. This came to like $15,000. Then he split town a couple weeks later and told me, \"this mess is not my problem and that I owe you nothing.\" My dad's frame of reference is so fucked he thought he made out on this deal. Smh.\n\nI told this brother that he was a horrible piece of shit and that I never want to speak to him again either.\n\nI could stand my brothers just walking away from the situation and having the decency to keep quiet about it but any communique ends with them regarding me for being \"the asshole that stayed\". Their words. This hurts. So uncool. So selfish of them. \n\nI find the entire mess extremely tiring and humiliating. I often can't sleep at night when I dwell on this shit... how I lost two brothers. How my am I going to get rid of the mess? How can I afford to? How could they pull this shit on me after all we went through together?\n\nI just always thought that family was supposed to stick together no matter what and I feel so devastated and abandoned that my brothers would betray me and my sisters like that.

Truth is, he's struggling, at least from what he's told me. \n\nHe isn't even bad looking, but he's not happy that he keeps getting treated like...a bit of a bitch I guess, from his his own words. He's not respected, and is viewed as friend zone (not even friend zone, more like 'bitch zone', lol). \n\nHe's too nice, effeminate and has no backbone. When he wants to 'get with' a girl, he starts talking to her as he would a friend but comes across as too nice. He'd be a great friend, for sure, but that's now what *he* wants. He wants to be hooking up with girls like his friends are doing at parties.\n\nHe came to me for help, and pleaded me to help. Now I am 5 years his senior, but I've slept with quite a lot of girls while at uni, again, uni is different, but it's pretty clear that my brother looks up to me for this. I gave him some core advice:\n\n- Stop being nice. From now on, you are not a nice guy. I don't care if you have to do a 180 and act like a douchebag, even that is better than being a nice boy. No more nice guy means no more mr effeminate bitch boy. He has to be more masculine (masculinity = good).\n\n- No more talking to girls like friends. You are being dishonest when wanting to befriend girls. You don't even want female friends (and you don't need them, you have male friends). From now on, if a girl tries talking to you, be disinterested and be aloof\n\n- When this works, many girls WILL be attracted to you. Don't get into a relationship, you can do that shit in your 30s. If you want sex, have sex, and then don't text them after\n\n- Main advice: **Don't listen to girls advice, INCLUDING my older sister's advice (26F), we will call her Georgia. Georgia has given him advice on girls and said ''You need to be nice, respectful and considerate, that's all you need''. Obviously this advice has proven useless. I told my younger bro that basically...girls just want a guy who ''gets it'', obviously asking a woman for advice she will give you the wrong advice (unknowingly) because they want the guy to ''just get it''**\n\nNow my bro has implemented my advice and he has slept with 1 girl so far and gotten a blow job from another. Some of the people at school were initially resistant to his new personality, but I said he had to force it. And now after a short while...he got laid, they are now ''re adjusting'' to the new him, and not the bitch boy.\n\nNow the main conflict here is that my sister Georgia knows what I told him and shouted at me saying I am ''filling his mind with crap'' and that I'm a douchebag, but then I said to my sister back ''You don't even care about the kid...he came to you for advice and you gave him half assed crap''.

One of my employees was just diagnosed with stage 4 cancer and needless to say is going to be needing some time off. When she told us of her situation we were more than happy to help her out with her schedule. This also meant that we needed to get the other employee on board with picking up some shifts which, at the time, she had no problem with. Now it’s four days after the diagnosis and the confirmed stepping up for coverage conversation and the second employee needs to take three days off to “go out of state”. I am the manager of that store and all shift changes need to go through me and everyone knows this. She text my husband telling him she needed those days off. He runs two other businesses and simply did not reply because 1. He is not her manager and 2. He did not find her excuse for her time off to be justified after just having that conversation and not being notified of the time off then. I called her the next day to see what she needed the time off for but before I could even ask her she said she was busy and needed to go. I was watching her on the cameras and it was not busy. Now it is a week later, the week of the time needed off, and she text me (Hasn’t text me in 2 weeks) saying that because I did not give her an answer to get her license fixed she no longer needs the time off because flights are too expensive. How should I respond? I feel like an ass hole but I also feel like that she’s trying to make me feel that way. \n\nTLDR: after my employee offered to pick up shifts for her coworker with cancer she asked her non manager for 3 days off and avoided her actual manager then the week of vacation told the actual manager she no longer needs time off because the manager took too long to respond.

I've wanted to be a mom my whole life but right now, I'm only 17 (just turned 17 a few weeks ago) and need to focus on school and working my part time job to save up for my first apartment, so I don't know that much about caring for babies. One day, my mom's friend, let's call her E, comes up to me and says, \"Hey - my name- wanna make a quick few bucks?\" I say yes because I was running low on money and I didn't want to have to dip into my savings to help my mom pay rent. (She's a single mom who can't work because if she works her medical will be revoked and each bottle of insulin she need to survive is around $300, so we're basicly able to pay for rent, food, and that's it, and sometimes things come up to where we might be late for rent) E tells me that she wants to take my mom out  and that I need to watch her baby for two hours and that she will be back here to get her at exactly midnight. E told me that she'll put the baby down to sleep before she leaves and I thought \"this should be easy\" by the time 2:00 am rolls around I'm having an extreme panic attack because the baby is crying and I don't know what's wrong (Not the greatest with kids and don't know that much on how to care for them, remember?) I've tried calling my mom 20 times and left 15 voicemails, and tried calling E a few times but it just went straight to voicemail. At 2:30 ish, E comes and gets the baby and leaves. The next day, I hear both E and her boyfriend calling me stupid and irresponsible for not knowing how to take care of a baby like they did when at my age they were already parents and were forced to know those things. Now when I talk to either E or her boyfriend they act like I'm a huge incontinence on everything.

My roomate said that I listened to stuff too loud in my room, that he absolutely hates it when I bring my phone into the kitchen while listening to a video (I cover the speakers as I walk by my roomate's room) and I rarely have my phone at over half volume. He explained that I keep him up at night when talking on discord or listening to an audio book before going to sleep (unless I'm sleeping in the same room as someone I prefer not to wear headphones when I go to sleep).

I thought I wasn’t a part of the tension until now.\n\nOne of my roommates, H, has been sort of annoying about cleaning. She is a clean freak except doesn’t clean her stuff up to the same standard she holds others to. Stuff like leaving banana peels, dirty dishes, and other trash on the counter, but getting mad about the trash not being taken out or the floors not being swept. As a result, we’ve made a chore chart of sorts to determine who does what when. \n\nImportantly for this, I am almost never at the apartment except to sleep and shower, as I work 30 hours a week along with going to class. I pretty much never use dishes, and when I do I clean them up immediately. In the conversation with the chore chart, it was pointed out that this means I don’t have to do as much stuff in the kitchen, which was reflected in our chart. In this conversation it was also acknowledged that nobody had any problems with me.\n\nTonight, one of my roomies, B, sent a text in our groupchat (it’s hard for all of us to talk in person because of schedules) about laudry. It was a salty text, which I get because she works long hours and H is loud and wakes her up a lot. \n\nIn this conversation, I said if anyone has a grievance they should “call me out”. I meant this in the colloquial sense, but could have phrased it better.\n\nH took it literally. At the end of a message saying she wanted to work everything out and get rid of the tension, she says this: “also @(my name), if you could do the dishes or sweep or take out the trash every now and then that would help.” I took this as patronizing, as we had already discussed our roles regarding chores and I have been doing my jobs.\n\nI responded: “H, i understand your concern and will work to be better, however i’ve been following the chart for cleaning and i don’t even use dishes more than once every two weeks. i want to emphasize that i am just as invested as you all are in making sure there isn’t tension.  things have been really tense in the apartment lately and to be completely honest i’m kind of confused as to why. that being said, please tell me if you have anything you think i need to work on. however, H, i really don’t appreciate being literally @‘ed when it comes to something like this. i may be misinterpreting as it is easy to do via text, but that sounded super patronizing.” \n\nH gets offended by this and then says I shouldn’t be offended by communication when I just said I was open to being “called out”.  She then continued by saying that she doesn’t get what the big deal is and that she doesn’t feel comfortable in her own\n\n I’m upset because I wasn’t under the impression I had said anything wrong, but H’s response has me feeling like I have.

One guy dropped out and a girl, let’s call her Anna, said her friend would want to live with us. Her friend, Emma, moved in at the start of July with Anna, but Emma hadn’t yet signed on officially or paid the deposit (Anna had). Then suddenly both of them turned round and ditched the house citing some bullshit reasoning and decided to live in a two person flat on their own. We then scrambled to find new housemates, one of who had to pay for the first months rent even though she hasn’t lived in the house in July because Emma never committed. \n\nThat was all a massive hassle for all of us and meant that I lost out on some paid work in the summer because I had to be at this house to sort out new tenants rather than in my hometown. I was very happy to set all that aside until the other day I asked who’s boxes of clothes have been stored under the table in the living room. I had assumed they were my housemate’s but it turns out they belong to Emma and she has not been to pick them up. A couple of us have reached out to her on social media to ask her about what she wants to do with all her stuff but she doesn’t reply.

It was a Friday evening and the LARP was scheduled for the next evening, and the dress code was pretty simple (pants &amp; long sleeve shirt, no collar). The dress code was 100% optional and only intended as a means of getting into character. The LARP only had about 20 people in it, and it wasn’t any official event or anything, just something to do for fun.\n\nMy partner drove me to the thrift store to help choose a shirt, which again, could have been almost anything, and was totally optional. We didn’t check the hours beforehand, and when we got there, we noticed that the store closed at 6. It was 5:46. \n\nAs a rule, I try not to enter a store less than 30 minutes before closing. I know retail workers are generally expected to have the store closed and cleaned by closing time, and I don’t want to be a dick to retail employees who need to close the cash register. Whenever I’m with someone who wants to enter a store that close to closing, I am super apologetic and try to make sure we leave as soon as possible. My partner knows this.\n\nMy SO, who is a retail worker, insists that the store is open, so customers can still be there, and that the employees just have to deal with it. \n\nWe went inside, and the cashier, the only worker, informed us that the store closed in 5 minutes. My partner made a remark towards me that she was rushing us out early and was annoyed by that, insisting that we had time. \n\nI looked through the dvds while my SO looked for shirts. I thought my SO could handle finding a shirt alone, and figured I was around for consulting if necessary but didn’t need to help look. Meanwhile, the cashier was getting more and more annoyed. A couple more people walked in, and she informed them that the store was closing soon.\n\nSO keeps asking my opinion on every shirt and then rejecting every single one. I say to just pick one so we can leave. SO tries on a couple, can’t decide, and keeps putting them on the rejected clothing rack. I see something I want and decide to buy it, go up to the cashier and pay for my item, apologizing for being there so close to closing. Cashier, visibly annoyed, says nothing. \n\nMy SO comes out of the dressing room a but later, pays and reminds me to pay for my item. I say I already paid for it, like 10 minutes ago. I get a snarky response and my SO gets upset at me for rushing us and being annoyed that it took so long. We leave the store and my SO points out that we weren’t even the last ones to enter or leave the store. I say I don’t feel comfortable being in a store that close to closing.\n\nThe cashier was clearly rude here and shouldn’t have been rushing us, but I think she was perfectly justified in wanting us out sooner.

To start off, I was 17m, my girlfriend was 18f. We'll call her dirt. So, I had just started up another year of school. And already from the last year, I've had my own circle of friends. Consisting of 3 males, including myself. And 3 females. A balanced group, a few of them; dirt in particular, I've never really paid much attention to, and didn't really care about them as much as the others as they always had their own flaws that annoyed me. Now me, being decently young back then, didn't really ever have a girlfriend before. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd to my shock, only about 2 months after knowing dirt. The messenger of our group, we'll call her mike, so mike, had just received a little gossip on dirt's recent crush, which just so happened to be me. At the end of the day, mike told me about it. I was mind blown, confused, dumbfounded. Basically a surge of emotions rolling around screaming what the hell is going on?? But I made up my mind. I wanted to try having a girlfriend, and so I did. The first few months went smoothly, she was so kind, and i was kind straight back. And the time we spent was fun. I couldn't have really asked for more. Then, at the end of the school year; my parents decided they'd like to finish my education by homeschooling me. Naturally, being myself. I agreed on a whim. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt wasn't until later when I looked into it more, that I realized I wouldn't be able to see dirt anymore. So our relationship would become long distance from now on.  So we went our separate ways, still together. But not in real life. In the first 3 months, I was hit with a heavy depression by this fact. I wouldn't leave my room for hours and i stopped caring about things. And to make things worse, when I finally recovered. She changed, she was like a different person almost. It was subtle but I could tell. At the time i had no clue and blissfully passed it off, but looking back now the signs were clear and I had the chance to run.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is when it started, no longer theoretically being in moderation by me, she was free to do as she wished. And as such, she could change her priorities. So she started caring less, as dumb as I was, even I saw this coming. But the thing is, there was so much more to it. even now I don't know the half of what she did behind my back. She started being friends with my sister, and she started ERPing as well, (which stands for Erotic Role Playing) Of course at the time I had no clue she did this as I trusted her enough to not have to look on her social medias, otherwise I would have immediately ditched her for cheating.  And after this, started the deception and lies, she would lie to me. I would want to confront her about things she's been doing that don't really sit well in a relationship. But every time, she would pass it off. Then talk to my sister,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I'm not just being jealous here, she genuinely cared about my sister more than I. And I wasn't to happy as you could imagine, as that's not how this works. Multiple times i confronted her, to not avail. But, in the end started to grow knowledgeable. I realized that my issues can't be solved by no means that i've tried. And that I need to end it. She's showed all the unspoken and implied signs of a manipulative psychopath. So how would i go about this? At the time, I was still my too nice for my own good gullible self, I couldn't simply end it by talking to her about it, even on a whim. \n\nSo out of ideas, and approaching the 2 year mark for our realtionship, I decided, if I'm too weak to end it. I'll just get her to end it for me. So, I did the thing that annoyed her the most. Surpassing her, every time she tried to speak something factual, I would correct it, and the thing is, it was super easy, she's not the brightest so almost everything she said would have a bottom line or different answer. Eventually, she had enough and we finally broke up. There's more to this experience, but this is all that's relevant to the title.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo in all in all, I simply want to know Am i the asshole for doing what I did? And did i need to do it that way? Or were there better choices here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: 17m, 18f girlfriend started off nice and happy, moved on to be a pyscho, discovered things about her.\n\nDecided to try and end it, not good enough to end it, so i let her do it for me by getting her to a point where she was sick of me.",

To be completely frank, it's gotten to the point where most open surfaces have begun to lose their functionality simply because of the sheer amount of stuff lying about on them that I'm too lazy to move.\n\nMy room is very messy, but it's not unlivable for me. I'm not even against cleaning it, but I absolutely hate that G is the one telling me to do it. She's not my mother, so I really don't feel like she has the right to tell me what to do, and anyway it's my room. If she's uncomfortable with the clutter then she doesn't have to come over--even though i honestly think my room is the best location for our study sessions because of its convenience, I would be perfectly content to meet up in her room or in the common areas of the dorm if my room is too messy for her to handle. I actually plan to clean it soon, but I want to do it on my own time and by my own volition, not because someone else told me to do so.\n\nEven so, G is in my room a lot, and I know it's probably extremely uncomfortable for her to sit around in my filth (although I do try to keep her favorite spot, a little sitting area under my bed, reasonably clean). The more she nags me, though, the less I want to do anything about the clutter. Would I be an asshole to tell her to keep out of my business, even though she's partially affected? I can tell that she's also as frustrated as I am about the situation, but I don't think I'm in the wrong to want autonomy in my own space that she's under no obligation to share with me.\n\nSo, AITA?",

		"story": "For context. I’m 17, I live in Australia, recently graduated high school and got an offer from the University of Adelaide. I wanted to defer, but my father vehemently denied me that right. \n\nFor even more context that led up to what my father said. Over the past three and a half years, I got put into a boarding school I didn’t really like, but put up with regardless. I’ve never really had a healthy relationship with my father, as I’m always terrified of his volatile temper, and he was almost never willing to spend time with me as a child. However, he did work to provide me and my family with a comfortable life. At that boarding school, I was overwhelmed with the workload I had to face since I never had to study to get top grades (I only went to international schools before), and asking teachers and friends for help has always been extremely uncomfortable for me. This in turn led to my studies not being great, and me getting a very average ATAR of 61.70. However, I was still able to get into the course I wanted.\n\n\nNow, I haven’t been the best child, but I was never the worst. I had never gotten detention, had never handed in a late assignment, and had never gotten into trouble with teachers. The worst thing I had done at school was not ask teachers for help and not put in as much effort as I should have. The worst thing I did to my parents was steal some money from their credit card, which is awful as is - however, I don’t think it warranted my father telling me to kill myself. He constantly tells me that I wasted three and a half years of my life, that he wasted money on getting me tuition, and that I put him and my mother under stress that no other parent has to face. He also claims I’m the reason they’re so close to divorce. He also sometimes calls me an useless moron and that I’m the most lazy and awful person he’s ever known. A few days ago, I fucked up researching housing costs for my university, and he lost it. He proceeded to yell all of the above at me, and then said, without paraphrasing, “A few months ago you told the bloody counsellors that you wanted to kill yourself? Well maybe you should have killed yourself then, it would have been easier on all of us.” I started crying really badly and he yelled at me asking why the fuck I was crying and I said through tears that he told me to\nKill myself, and he said “You’re goddamn right, you don’t deserve to live anymore, go hang yourself tomorrow.” The next day my mom told me I should feel guilty because I hurt my dad so much and that I should feel bad for making him say those things, and that I should look past it. Again, the extent to which I “hurt” my parents was listed above. A few days later I got my acceptance letter, and two days later I told my parents I wanted to defer. My dad lost it again, asking me who the fuck I am to have the arrogance to defer, and that I should be taking this god-given gift and studying hard, rather than fucking deferring, and that I should go fuck myself.\n\n\nSorry if this is a rambling mess, I’m on mobile and don’t really know how to format. I believe I’ve covered everything on both sides, so please let me know if clarification is needed. I really want to run away from my parents and start over, but because I’m 17 my father is still controlling me and forcing me to start university immediately. I feel bad because I have done some things that are wrong, but I don’t feel they’ve warranted what’s been said to me. In short - am I the asshole here?\n\n",

Her mother has never been a good role model - keeping publicly abusive relationships, drinking constantly and not being there for her daughter. Her family life over all has always been hard.  She has dealt with depression and anxiety her whole life.\n\nMy friend has never been able to keep a job more than a couple months since high school. She just quits randomly. I’ve paid thousands of dollars for her over the years in the form of rent, food and entertainment so that she can enjoy nights out with our friend group. \n\nShe has two children who she sees every other week because her and the dad are separated. When she doesn’t have the kids, she goes on drinking benders. During these, she will start shit with her family members and boyfriends causing huge fights. She just got a DUI a couple months ago and is now on probation but is refusing to stop drinking or doing drugs.\n\nShe has wanted to kill herself for years, and has acted on it tens of times. She will blow up everyone’s phones saying she is taking a bottle of pills and then not answer anyone’s calls. This was start her loved ones leaving responsibilities like work, racing around town while in tears trying to find her and getting the cops involved. Last episode she had called me for the first time saying she was going to kill herself which sent me into a panic and i had to go track her down in a crying panic thinking my friend would be dead by the time I got there. Every time is has turned out she didn’t actually take pills and she was saying/doing crazy shit cause she had been drinking. I have stopped inviting her out with new people because she will show up wasted and embarrass me.\n\nI was already distancing myself a bit because I couldn’t emotionally deal with the chaos, but the last straw was when I foolishly let her borrow a few hundred dollars. She had a new job and seemed to be doing well, so I told her yes but I needed it back in two weeks. She promised me she’d have the money back to me “100%”. She said she needed help because her kids’ dad fucked her over on daycare. Turns out she quit that job the day prior (after 1 week of being there) and that she actually needed that money for rent. She told me all of this a week later and genuinely didn’t seem to realize that her story was much different than what she told me before. That deadline is now three months ago. She has brought up paying me back once. She got another job a couple weeks ago and I heard from a friend she already quit it.\n\nShe’s had a history of dating physically and mentally abusive men. Yesterday I get a call from her mom asking if I’d seen her because she hadn’t come home. I say no and automatically know what this is about. The night prior she had texted me bragging how she cheated on her boyfriend. This boyfriend has blatantly said to our group of friends that he’s not afraid to beat a woman. I knew he was evil. Turns out her sister told him that she had cheated on him, he drove to her house, broke in, smashed her phone and beat her. She now has bruises all over her and is (hopefully) getting a restraining order. I was not surprised at all, I told my friend he’d beat her one day and my friend (who is also one of her bfs) didn’t believe me. He is an overly-obvious abusive person. Yelling at her constantly in front of strangers, acting crazy all of the time.\n\nIn summary, I’m caught up because I have suffered from crippling anxiety and depression but it’s never brought this type of destruction onto everyone around me or myself. It seems at this point she’s choosing all of these awful things to happen to her at this point. (Besides being beat obviously). Blatantly self-sabotaging. Which I know can be from mental illness. Where do you draw the line blaming it on mental illness? I don’t want to be dragged into this anymore. I care about her and her wellbeing but it’s been 10 years of this chaos. \n\nSomething happens every week. And every week either she or her mom will call me to talk about it, thinking that I need to be informed of what happened. The same shit that always happens. Nothing ever changes, and in fact gets worse every year.

Here's what I mean: my partner and I, we were friends before high school (and therefore debate) even started. Our friend group is the same. On the other hand, James and Mary come from two different 'cliques': James is popular in and out of debate, confident, and friends with all the more social, showy members of the team who joined because they love public speaking and all that. Mary is quiter, more intellectual and into philosophical stuff, and is friends with the more intellectual wing of the debate team. So a joint ticket with them has a chance to get votes from both groups. \n\nThe thing is, while I'm not friends with either of them, I know from casually talking to them that neither of them are really happy with the relationship, but don't want to break up because they'll know it'll effect their debate partnership. Mary kind of sees James as 'big mouth, small brain'. James sees Mary as overly idealistic, anti social, and at times boring. \n\nSo I told each of them what the other thought of them. This caused an argument in the middle of the debate meeting, and they actually broke up then and there. James was legit crying, and he blamed me for this.

When we first kissed, we had been hanging out for a majority of the day; we were definitely “cuddly” and flirty to the point where it felt like we were dating, which is something I wasn’t really comfortable with. As I was leaving her room that night, she was the one to lean in first. I was a bit taken aback because I hadn’t really known her for that long — so I told her after we kissed that I wanted to take things slowly. She says ok, everything’s fine, we make out again a day or so later.\n\nNow here’s what happened. I’m in class the next week a day before my birthday, and I get a text from her while my phone is off (I usually have it off in class). She knows what class it is and where. When I get back to my room, I turn on my phone and I see the missed messages from her saying that she would be outside my classroom’s building waiting until my class ended with cookies she baked me for my birthday. For the record, I didn’t see her waiting outside the building when I left.\n\nI know you may be thinking: that’s so nice of her, how cute, etc… but I honestly felt like it was weird. I have been in relationships before and this sort of stuff didn’t happen too often, let alone in the first week. Then this girl who I haven’t known for more than a week or so tells me she’s waiting outside with cookies she’s made me as if it’s a promposal.\n\nAnyways, I text her saying I’m sorry for not seeing her messages before and that I was busy, and she responds that its okay. But the whole incident gives me weird vibes — from the way she was acting she definitely made it seem like we were dating. After this incident, I mostly stopped talking to her, and didn’t continue hanging out with her until the whole thing fizzled out. I could definitely tell she was trying to keep things going, but the encounter put me off.\n\nAm I an asshole for ghosting her?",

This is because they have been emotionally abusing me for the last five years of my life (I’m sixteen now). My parents constantly belittle and criticize me for arbitrary things that I do. They’ve controlled my social life with my friends and tried to isolate me as much as they can. They listen in on the few phone calls I get and keep me from visiting my friends (many of whom I have lost contact with due to the five years of isolation). They have even pulled me out of the public schooling system and have chosen to ‘homeschool’ me (in reality, they don’t teach me anything). \n\nMy dad is always extremely aggressive towards me and lacks any sort of empathy for me. He used to be a good father, but he became a nightmare soon after my grandmother died. He tries to intimidate me constantly. He destroys the things I buy with my own money. Just last month, he took away a tablet that I recently bought with my own money that I earned working as a fast-food cashier. \n\nMeanwhile, my mom shows clear signs of being a narcissist. She constantly acts superior to me and refuses to acknowledge any of my feelings. Whenever I talk to her, she always ignores what I’m trying to say and constantly berates me for “not being good enough.”\n\nAs a result, I’ve resorted to playing video games as an outlet. At this point, my games are the only things that matter to me anymore. They’re an escape from the horrible life my parents create for me. \n\nI hate them. They think they’re the smartest people in the world, but they don’t know anything. They expect so much from me when they give me nothing. I want to run away from home soon. I would need to steal some more money in order for me to survive, but I’d do anything to get away from them.\n\nThe reason I’ve been stealing the money is to get back at them. Honestly, my parents have made my life a living hell, and I hardly want to wake up in the mornings. They always call me a spoiled brat whenever I play any video games. They’re always trying to take away my one joy in life, so I figured I would take away the only thing they seem to care about. Over the past year or so, I’ve been taking money from my parents and spending it all on in-game purchases and electronic devices. At the time, I thought it was only fair since they abused me and took away a lot of my stuff.\n\nBut still, a part of me feels a bit guilty. I know I’m being too generous considering my parents’ awful behavior, but I still feel like taking the money might have been wrong. Dad was really close to my grandma. He used to be nice before my grandma died. Mom’s been getting in a lot of fights with dad too. Sometimes, I wonder if maybe I’m doing something to deserve this.\n\nThat’s the full story, I guess.

Fast forward about 6 months,  J’s dad received a job offer which forced his parents to move a further 2 hour drive east, so D and J could not do that due to work commitments, so they moved to an inner city apartment. D had no idea how to move her belongings, even refused to hire a truck so she basically begged a bunch of people. I was one of her only friends with a car so I was roped into doing some of the moving, although I didn’t particularly want to. For me it was a 1 hour drive to J’s place, then it was a further 2 hours back to their new apartment, and this trip happened 3 times.

This time it was only 1 trip, but I was very reluctant to help as I remembered the horrors of last time (for reference she has severe OCD with her things).  So reluctantly I went and helped her, wasting my Friday night that I could have spent out with my friends.

But after it’s all said and done, we have a little get together with a few mates the next night and we come to the part where I may be the asshole. So she was just talking about money and debt she owes to people to my friend, and then she mentions that she owes me $50 for the move, then says I should have done it for free as we were friends. This was in reference to the other guy that helped her move, she had known him for about a year and he didn’t accept any payment, just food. I was taken aback a little as I know had the situation been reversed, she would not have helped me and my girlfriend move.

It was only an hour's flight and not far enough that we couldn't handle it. We had some hiccups in the relationship, which is that I'm not a really expressive or overly affectionate person. This is a recurring theme, even though I tried hard to work on it because I wanted to be with him, and he had anxiety which made coping with it difficult if he didn't feel like I was investing enough. It's especially harder online because you can't be there physically with someone, so the feeling of emotional distance is amplified.\n\nGW2 was the one thing we shared, and I sort of drifted away from it. There was a series of small events and eventually I needed a break from the game, which is not uncommon for me. I've been playing on and off since release with a few year long breaks after burning out. I'm a very sarcastic and 'shit-talking' type of person. Everyone in the guild took what I said with a grain of salt. We insulted each other playfully and talked shit all the time. I found out later that a girl (she will be important later) in the guild felt like I'd been bullying her. We weren't close and even though I was treating her the same I did everyone else, she didn't reciprocate the same feeling of banter and took it to heart. I felt absolutely awful and tore myself up about it for a long time.\n\nI reached out to her and eventually we mended things, and I thought everything was okay. My bf and this girl ended up getting really close. She had bad depression and they bonded. I'm not the jealous type of girlfriend so I was perfectly okay with them ending up being best friends. Well, it turned out that she was basically in love with him. She flirted with him all the time, and they spent more and more time together. Even though I tried to get him to shut down the flirting, he didn't want to be mean to her or shut her down. It started to make me feel insecure, like I was competing for his time and not able to live up to this other girl.\n\nYou'll recall that I mentioned we were having problems in our relationship. He felt like I wasn't spending enough time with him, that I spent too much time with other people, but he didn't want to play any other game except GW2 even though I was super burnt out. Because video games are how we bonded and it was how we spent time with one another, I tried really hard to get him to try something else so we could play together. He didn't want to, and got upset when I was in calls and games with other people.\n\nWe ended up having a long talk where we discussed where our relationship was going. We mutually agreed that we might not last, but would give it a few more weeks to work things out. The thing that ultimately broke us was when I found out that he had been running a whole bunch of new content with her, even though I had been asking him to play with me so we could spend time together. He was basically brushing me off for her after complaining we didn't spend time together. On top of that, he said she had said things to him like 'you're just being with her because it's easy' and apparently purposefully trying to drive a wedge between us, and she kept flirting, but to my knowledge he never told her off for her behaviour and I didn't want to be 'that' girl who goes off at a boyfriend's female friend. He also made it clear that he wasn't going to stop being friends with her and didn't want me talking to her about it. It felt like he wasn't trying anymore, that he was being a hypocrite, and he just wanted her more, so I broke up with him.\n\nI left the guild because it was too hurtful being in the same one as my ex boyfriend and the girl who ultimately destroyed out relationship. I'd been in that guild for years and played with the people in it for a long, long time. I loved it there, and it was an emotional haven for me on some occasions. I felt resentful that I was the one who ended up leaving, even though I felt as though I'd done nothing wrong, and I still do. But I needed time to heal, and they weren't going anywhere any time soon, so I left. After I did, I sent the girl a rather... nasty message that went along the lines of 'are you happy now? you got what you wanted' and called her, I think, a 'homewrecking sl\\*t'. I was angry and hurt and lashing out, and I don't condone what I said, but there it is. No one said anything to me about it so I thought it might not have even been received (it had been).\n\nMy ex and I remained on OK terms. I owed him some money and was in the process of paying it back, our conversations were casual and pleasant. Once I did, he eventually removed me from social media and whatnot. I was a little surprised but got over it.\n\nIt's been over a year now, and I wanted to start playing GW2 again. I miss the people I played with and I'm ready to put water under the bridge, talk things out, maybe not be friends but at least be able to hang around each other. I reached out to my old guild leader a week and a half ago, who runs a Twitch stream and a public server. He said he was happy to welcome me back, but only on the terms that myself, ex and his now-gf (yes they ended up happily dating), are on okay terms since he didn't want things to be 'awkward'. I was really annoyed about this decision because I didn't (and still don't) think it's fair for me, and just me, to be excluded. I said that awful shit when I left, but I wasn't the only one who played a hand in how horribly everything turned out. I don't think it's fair that me joining back rests on my ex and his girlfriend.\n\nBut I reached out anyway. I've spoken to him and he basically told me 'why would we want you back?' and asked me if I remembered the message I sent his gf after I left. I said I did, but I was really hurt, and that I know it was childish. But I wanted to talk about it and hoped that we could at least settle things and talk about it like adults. I refrained from pointing out that he and his gf also helped to sabotage things and that I'm not the only one to blame for what happened because I don't want to cause a fight and ruin things again.\n\nHe told me it basically rests on his gf because I hurt her the most and whatever makes her happy makes him happy. I've sent her a msg but no reply. It's tearing me apart waiting. I feel awful thinking that they probably see me as this heartless monster but it makes me upset/angry, too, because that's not what I am. I refuse to believe that I'm the sole villain here and I feel like this situation is unfair. I'm willing to give them a chance and I would like the same in return.\n\nRegardless of whether or not I guess back in the guild, I am still going to be in the twitch server, where both of them also talk, so I don't see why it matters. We are going to be around each other anyway, and I would rather have us talk about the elephant in the room than avoid each other til the end of time.\n\nAm I crazy? Am I the asshole, an an asshole? Is it reasonable for me to want to come back after over a year to talk things out? Do you think they're being fair?",

		"story": "One of my best friends, Joe, has a birthday coming up. He has been dating Natalie for about a year and recently I went on vacation with the two of them to Montreal for spring break, along with our other friend and my partner. Natalie was completely obnoxious for the whole weekend. She seemed to view the entire experience as an opportunity to beef up her Instagram. She was taking pictures of random crap the entire time. At one point, she took away my drink at a coffee shop for three minutes as she tried to take the perfect picture of everyone’s coffee together on the table. Additionally, she was just kind of a party-pooper the whole time. She held Joe back from going places with the rest of us. She made Joe leave places early. She acted in a super immature way with the way she interacted with me and my partner (nothing I can put my finger on, she just was acting like a 14-year-old trapped in a college student’s body.) And on top of all that, she made some mildly homophobic comments that my partner and I did not appreciate at all. I never really liked her before, but suffice it to say, I was completely disillusioned with her by the end of the trip. \nA few days later, I received a Facebook message from Natalie. She created a group chat of six or seven people saying “Joe mentioned a while back that he wanted (thing) for his birthday. I was wondering if you guys would be willing to split the cost. It should come out to $15/person depending on the shipping cost.” Someone else in the group chat, my friend Mike, immediately replied “lol no” and Natalie removes him from the group. I am very tight on money lately because of the fact that I took a trip to Montreal for spring break so I’ve been trying to be more frugal. Natalie is from a very wealthy family. She has never had a job in college, and she travels abroad seemingly every other month. I usually buy Joe something small myself for his birthday, and the gift that Natalie wanted to get him is not something that would come from me, as it’s not related to an interest that Joe and I share. So in light of all that, I replied in the group chat “i’m sorry but I’m pretty tight on money! i can’t!” Natalie said “damn ok” and removed me from the group. Then I messaged Mike to ask him why he said no, and he said he was annoyed that Natalie kept Joe from his birthday party about a month prior to this. Mike and Joe are longtime best buds. \nFinally, just a few minutes ago, Joe and I went to eat dinner in our dining hall, and Natalie arrived along with her roommate and our other friend who came to Montreal. Natalie completely refused to acknowledge my existence for the entire 15 or so minutes we were sitting directly across from each other. As I was leaving, I said “bye everybody!” and she didn’t look up from her phone. It seems that she is pissed at me for not wanting to contribute to the gift. AITA?",

TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo for the past few months I'd been in a relationship with a guy who I was hopelessly in love with. He never told me he felt as strongly as I did but he had hinted at it sometimes. \n\nA few weeks ago he decided to break up with me, claiming that he thought it would be better if we were just friends. I was obviously heartbroken and cried about this for days, but he was adamant that we could only be friends and nothing more. We did, however, carry on talking.\n\nI eventually got used to this and started to come round to being just friends. In order to boost my self-esteem (which was shattered after the break up) I got on tinder and ended up sleeping with a few people. I thought this would be fine as we were no longer seeing each other, I had no obligation to stay loyal to him. This didn't help me get over it and I'm still very much in love with him.\n\nFast forward to today and I let it slip that I had slept with other people and he immediately blocked me. Later, his friend informed me that him breaking up with me was actually a test. He was still in love with me and he just wanted to 'see what I would do'.

We agree and disagree on many topics, and have had lots of great discussions and not held our differences against each other.\n\nShe is obese to the point that it is physically disabling.

We're lesbians. I asked her to marry me six months ago and our wedding will be held in a year and a half. We're extremely excited, planning on having kids after the wedding and so on. She's everything I've ever dreamed of and knew from the first time I saw her that I'd make her my wife someday. She knew that as well. There is just one thing bothering me in our relationship. \n\nMy fiancée has a male friend, let's call him Hank. Hank is tall, his clothing and hair style is \"psychobilly\" and he lost his virginity at 26 by having sex with the 17-year-old daughter of his best friend. After that, he started a false rumour that the girl gave him chlamydia and he hasn't had sex since. He has also been unemployed for a long time, because according to him, he doesn't know how to make a CV. Y'know, the kind of a person I wouldn't want to hang around with. Hank is now 27 as well and was a co-worker of my fiancée about six years back, when we hadn't met yet. They became friends and have hung out ever since. However, another co-worker of theirs at that workplace at the time jokingly said to Hank that my fiancée had a crush on him, which is impossible since she's a lesbian. Hank, for some incomprehensible reason, believed it to be true. \n\nEver since then Hank has harassed my fiancée by saying stuff like \"I'd be the man of your dreams\", \"You just haven't tried my dick\", \"I love you and would make you happy\" etc... He insists that my fiancée should sleep with him in order to find out how amazing of a person he is and it doesn't matter that my fiancée is not interested, because according to him, starting a relationship with him would change how my fiancée sees him. He also demands she sees him at LEAST three times a week, and plays martyr (\"you're a bad friend, I'm so lonely, nobody wants to spend time with me\") when she doesn't. She feels horrible whenever Hank does this and doesn't understand why he can't just shut up about it. She's told him multiple, even hundreds of times that she is not interested and will never be. He doesn't accept that. This has gone on for about five years. \n\nNow, he isn't this bad all the time. The reason my fiancée hangs out with him still, is that he can be nice and not speak about that nasty stuff for a while and they share the same passion: cars. They can have a really nice time together and he might go for about a month without harassing her, but then start the bullshit again. \n\nHowever, I feel extremely annoyed and even hurt that my fiancée still hangs out with him. In the past she has cut all contact with him but when that happened, he started visiting her parents all the time, begging for them to reach out to her and ask her to \"be his friend again\". My fiancée says that she never wants that to happen again, as she doesn't want her parents involved. She has blocked him everywhere except instagram, through which they can plan to meet whenever he's being nice again. I have suggested that she could get a restraining order against him, but she says she doesn't want to hurt him and he's the only person she can talk about cars with. \n\nI told her this feels like she'd rather keep hurting me than hurt him. She said that she feels bad and if it comes to that, she will cut all contact with him. Just now she texted him and told him that if he ever talks about his feelings again, she will cut off all contact with him. \n\nAITA for wanting my fiancée to stop being his friend? If not, any advice? \nI feel extremely disrespected but also guilty when my fiancée tells me he's the only person with whom she can talk about cars. \n\nShe read this text before I sent it to you guys so we're very open about the situation. \n\nTL;DR: We're lesbians, getting married in 2020. Fiancée has a male friend Hank, who won't stop sexually harassing her and insisting that she should sleep with him. Fiancée doesn't want to cut all contact with him, because he can be nice at times and he's the only friend she shares her car passion with. I feel disrespected.

She's a bit older than I am [I'm 20, M and she's 24] and we are super good friends. It's not uncommon for us to go for a beer after work, as we usually do night shifts together. \n\nThere's this other girl, let's call her J. J and M are about the same age, and J started working here around December. Now one thing about Starbucks (at least, where I come from) is that dating other baristas are not allowed, because it always leads to tension and drama. I've experienced this firsthand in my previous store, and it was a really awful experience. \n\nSo the tea is that M and J have been having sexual relations for the past month or so. M told me last night when she was quite drunk. The other problem is that M has a boyfriend and J has a girlfriend. I really didn't know what to say, because I think infidelity is a pretty awful thing to do when you're not in an open relationship and I didn't want to go through the whole ordeal that is workplace romance again.\n\nI personally decided to put an end to this. I didn't know what else to do.\n\nI talked to my assistant manager the next day. She went really quiet and told me she appreciated my confidence and that she would talk to our store manager to see if M or J can be transferred to another store, and that they can handle it in a private, respectful manner. \n\nAITA for meddling in a situation that wasn't my business and breaking my friend's trust like that?",

		"story": "Hello, all! First time posting to this sub, so I hope everything is in order as far as the rules go. I'm sharing this story to find out who is *truly* the asshole in this situation. I know this may seem kind of petty, but it has been bothering me for a little while now. This post will be a bit long, but I will include a TL;DR at the end.\n\nA little backstory: In the Fall term of 2016, I enrolled in a local University along with 2 of my friends. I keep to myself most of the time, going with the flow, and only speak up around friends or when I truly feel like I have something to add to the conversation among strangers, so finding a friend that first semester was kind of difficult. One of my friends introduced me to the asshole in question (AIQ from now on) about 2 months into the term. Everything seemed nice enough in the beginning, and we became friends in the spring semester after taking a foreign language class together. Jump to the fall term (2017), when my teacher announced an upcoming study abroad opportunity in the summer (2018). We were both excited to go, as this could be our only chance of going to a different country (AIQ is a STEM major so she was worried about spending a full term away and how her classes would be, and my mom would not allow me to spend a year away from home since it was my first time going out of the state). Both of us saved up to pay the program fee (faculty-led), deposits, and multi-city plane ticket (we studied abroad in 2 countries that summer). All the while during our free time in class, we talked about how much we couldn't wait to go, what we hoped the cities to be like, where we would go during our free time, etc. Now on to the events that transpired and what led me to cut ties with AIQ.\n\nIn the first country, everyone got along (along with the AIQ and I, there were 11 other people - again it was a faculty-led program, meaning that the foreign language instructors from the university went with us so there wasn't a bunch of people they had to look after). However, when we arrived in the second country, everything kind of turned to shit between the AIQ and I. It began with the AIQ getting snappy and rude with me whenever I asked a general question, even when I wasn't talking to them in particular. If I suggested we do something, she'd say \" we already did that yesterday without you\" or \"we're tired of doing that\". We had to share a room together in the second country, and she held on to the key because she could attach it to her wallet and we thought it'd be easier than trying to look through my small bag in case it sunk down to the bottom. Twice, she came back very late (at around 11:15, which was later than the teacher wanted us to be out), so I waited in the shared space of two other group members until she came back (which was around a 30 minute wait). The first time, she was very apologetic, saying that the train was late (very unusual considering that the trains in this country run every 5 minutes or so), but I accepted her apology. The second time (only two days later), she just huffed past me, unlocked the door, set her bags down (she had went shopping again), and didn't say a word to me until the next morning. As each day passed, communication between us became very limited. Me, not talking to her because I really didn't want to deal with her attitude, and her, for whatever reason she had made up. She only had this attitude with me and she treated the other group members with friendliness and were open to what they wanted to do (although she claimed she disliked two of the other group members, she didn't have an attitude with them).  \n\nShe kept that attitude towards me until we departed for home. The remainder of that summer, I didn't speak to her at all- not even a text. When I saw her again this semester (we take the same foreign language class now), she acted like nothing was wrong and even hugged me- something that she'd never done. We talked about how our lives were so busy now that we've begun our upper level course work. After that first day of class, I didn't talk to her very much because now I know what she is truly like. Friendly at first, but very rude and condescending once you've spent time with her.\n\nTL;DR: AITA for not talking to a friend after she was mean to me when we studied abroad?",

Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, “overloading the baby’s little body”. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she’s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She’s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can’t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she’s somehow positive for it. (She’s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I’m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I’m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn’t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I’m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe’s up in arms about this now saying how I’m being manipulative and abusive because I’m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she’s not. \n\nI don’t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it’s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she’s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she’s said how it’s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I’ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I’m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don’t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She’s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I’m comfortable with. I can’t go further than that. And now she’s upset that I’m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fiancée thinks vaccines are a hoax and don’t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. ",

We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating.

He jumped from the top of the bleachers once just to escape. I found out he was almost arrested for beating a small kid into a brick wall. I found out in my senior year he was expelled and arrested for trying to kill his mom and sister.\n\nI understand that no one asks to be born, and no one ever asks to be mentally disabled, but the things he’s done can’t be over looked. I was never a good person, but I never did anything close to what he did. I’m graduating this May, and my sis will be in high school in September. I’m worried he’s gonna come back and target her.

In fact, today, she had pre-paid for her own funeral and cemetery plot.\n\nShe has two sons - my dad and my uncle. Growing up, the grandchildren, we (some of us) were close to my Grandmother during her weekly visits. Up till we were around 12-15yrs old. But then we all grew up and did our own thing - being usual asshole teens/young adults. My parents, they were not exactly what you would call filial. My mum would complain about my Grandmother being naggy or slow or troublesome. My dad wouldn’t / couldn’t stand up for his own mum. I think my parents are receiving the taste of their own medicine because we are also demonstrating some form of non-filialness towards them one way or another now.\n\nBack to my grandma. In the past 4-5 years, as she became incapable of caring for herself, she was bounced from one nursing home to another nursing home. I never understood why my parents or my uncle’s side could not get hired help and accommodate her at home. All the grandchildren were adults and living away from home, some overseas, myself included. So there was definitely space at home and they just had to do the necessary old person’s renovations. But no one bothered. \n\nFast forward to today:\nMy grandmother’s funeral. My elder two siblings who never were that close to her, cried their eyeballs out and proclaimed that they were. They never saw her much / did anything for her - neither did I. My mum cried like it was her own Mother who died. My dad did too but in the last one year he did show some form of filial piety towards her (he regretted for not having a close relationship with her either due to personal reasons or because my mum is controlling of him like that).\n\nSo am i the asshole, for judging my siblings and mum for bawling their eyes out when they barely did anything / cared for her / even spoke to her much when she was alive? Am I the asshole for judging my siblings, especially one of my sister who is the most unfilial towards my mum, for now crying so much at my grandmother’s grave when she can do better/differently towards her living mother?\nAm I also the asshole for not shedding much tears when I was considered one of the closest to my grandmother when I was younger?\n\nTLDR: No one cared for my grandmother when she was alive, but all cried during her funeral.

We regularly hear tons of yelling from their apartment (from mom and kids) but can never distinguish if it's just kids yelling because they're kids, or yelling because they're in distress.

We reached out when they moved in but they didn't seem interested.

The reason I mention all this is because it seems clear the mom already doesn't think of us fondly.  She seems very hostile to her own children based on her constant yelling and swearing so we didn't talk to her before calling CPS in order to avoid any problems between us and her as neighbors. \n\nThe case worker followed up with me today noting there were no signs of abuse and told me a bit about how she's a single mom trying to make things work and is very upset by the whole scenario.

For a little over 3 years we have lived in NYC which I absolutely hate. It overwhelms me, it is outrageously expensive, and is just hard to live in unless you are one of the mega-rich. We moved to the city to pursue my wife's dream of becoming a professional actor. Initially, the plan was to live here for two years and if she had not accomplished much by that time we would move back home (we are from the southeast). \n\nDuring this time I have worked 4 different jobs and slowly made a decent living for us but it has been brutal. When we first moved I had to take a 100% commission job in sales just to get hired.  Seven days a week work because I had to sell or there was no money. Needless to say we blew through what savings we had pretty quickly, most of which was from selling my car to afford the first couple of months rent.

I have a good employer at this point, and our finances are at long last somewhat stable (been there 8 months). \n\nMy wife has made consistent progress in becoming an actor and trying to join one of the acting unions. She had to start with choir and ensemble roles, but over the time we have spent here she has worked and worked and made it in to principal roles and paid contracts.

I am extremely proud of her, and I have zero doubts that she isn't always doing her best to make something happen.

I have very little residual income at the end of each month after bills though fortunately at this point I do have some going in to a 401k. I was already starting to burn out and then a real life change occured....\n\nMy father passed away unexpectedly last spring. We knew he wasn't in great health, but this was a shock. I got the call one morning and he was just gone. I loved my dad, he was a tremendous man who made sure I had good opportunities and was always around for me as I grew up. I was so fortunate to have a father that truly cared. I say that because this was a soul-crushing blow to me and has completely shaken me to my core and I still feel it every day.\n\nBefore his death, I had the resolve from knowing that even though I didn't like living in NYC my wife loves it and that I am being a good spouse for giving her the opportunity to pursue her dream. But now I can't handle it. I have panic attacks all the time, I have been going to a psychologist since November and have had no significant breakthroughs. I feel depressed all the time. I am trying to see a psychiatrist but finding one that takes our insurance has been tough. I have a very hard time completing even basic functions, and I know that my mom and brother are struggling. \n\nI want to move back south asap and get closer to our family. I want to start preparing for my wife and I's life together and  getting to a place where I can deal with this grief. We speak about it all the time and I know she doesn't want to leave NYC. She will but her conditions have been that I have to have a job lined up before we can, and she only really is OK with moving to Atlanta, Georgia (we are not from Georgia) because there is a market for her work there. I am torn because part of me thinks that my health should 100% be a drop everything and lets get you right sort of scenario for her but it doesn't seem to be all of the time. Then I am also torn because I feel I should be stronger and able to handle these things so that she can keep working on what she wants whether it be in NYC or elsewhere. I think my mental stability has about 6 months tops left in the city before I really break.\n\nSo I guess all of that is to ask this question. Would I be the asshole if I, after a reasonable effort is spent, relocate us back south after devoting 3.5 years of my life to helping her with her goal of being an NYC actor?\n\nThank you to anyone kind enough to read through that wall of text.\n\ntl,dr\n\nI relocated to NYC for my wife a little over 3 years ago to support her in her dream of being a professional actor. I hate living there, she loves it. I am the breadwinner and pay 100% of our bills, but she has made progress in establishing her career. My father passed away last spring and now my mental health has gone to s**t with the grief making the anxiety I have from living in the city, on top of the sheer grief itself, even worse. She doesn't want to leave but will concede to relocating to ATL, GA as there is a market there for her work. I just want to get close to home. Would I be the asshole if I, after a reasonable effort is spent, relocate us back south after devoting 3.5 years of my life to helping her with her goal of being an NYC actor?",

(one month after signing a year long lease) I was very happy for her and her boyfriend however she quickly cut me off even though we still lived together. Two months later she tells me she is moving in two weeks and needs to be off our lease to sign her new one. She said she would pay her half of the rent for the remainder of our lease or until I found a new roommate because her boyfriend got rent paid for through military. I let her off the lease with that in mind. We're both full time students and part time employeed in small college town so naturally it's been rough to find a roommate (especially because my she moved out middle of October) after paying two months of her half of the rent she sends me a message completely unprompted to say that I'm a shitty friend for not having found a roommate yet. [Side note: she told me she was leaving on a specific day which she lied about because  I came home from work one day and she was just gone. She never said anything to me about it] and that she wasn't gonna give me anymore money for the rent because I've been given ample time to find one. I've now been put into a financial crisis because no one can move in due to their own leases not being up and I cannot handle the entire rent myself. Had to borrow money from my boyfriend which makes me feel shitty. So I sent her a message recently - even though we haven't talked since her message to me - and told her she wasn't a decent enough person to even think twice of the burden she put on me as well.

After I've been social in a large group (a.i. Christmas) I need about a day where I'm pretty much alone to rewind. I know this is atypical and I should probably have seen a psychiatrist at an early age, but I never did.

I see my grandparents pretty often but not my cousin.\n\nSo it was the day after Christmas, me, my mom and my brother were at my grandparent's house with my cousin and as the day progressed I became more and more tired as usual. I got about an hour alone while the rest were on a walk, but I still felt the rudeness show up, so when it came time to discussing whether we would stay for dinner I said I wanted to go home. Mom clearly heard me yet confidently said we would stay. I repeated myself this time expressing how tired I was, but she persisted. \n\nSo I said something like \"fine, then I'll take the bus. Goodbye\" and walked to the front door. Mom chased me and told me something like \"You are going to stay! Think of grandma, grandpa and your cousin.\" to which I replied, somewhat angrily: \"I said goodbye. I can go home when I want and I'm really tired right now. You know how that ends.\" She kept saying that this was going to ruin Christmas as I rushed out the door to the bus stop and the silence of the outside made me think more rationally. I didn't even get of the lawn before I realised that I had the car key so I went back inside to leave it there. \n\nNow my family were going home after all and my mom had railed everybody in the house. I told my mom that they should stay if they want to and I'll go home but for some reason that wasn't an option.\n\nFrom my mom's perspective I know she wants everyone to be together ~~and happy~~ as much as possible and stuff like this makes her really upset. She feels it's my duty to be well mannered and consequently social until she decides it's time to go home. She can't understand why an hour of rest shouldn't be enough to cover a day of socialising. \n\nFrom my perspective she does this so often. With this I mean try to guilt trip me into situations I'm not comfortable being. It's always \"Think of ... and ...! They'll be so sad and it will ruin our entire day!\" in even though the other people have said that I don't have to stay/go if I don't want to.

Before I worked here, there was another supervisor that worked in my place. A few years ago she lost her mother. She had to go back to Hungary for the funeral. A bunch of clients and residents had donated money but a few co-workers had also lent her some money too (about $1000). They gave it to her with the understanding that she would pay it back. Well months passed and she ended up leaving for a better job opportunity. Since then she's been avoiding calls from the people I work with and has only given them a fraction of what was loaned to her.\n\nNow come to the present time. A co-worker approached me yesterday and told me that his 92 year old grandmother has passed away. He explained that he would like to attend the funeral and be with family in his homeland, India. He was very sad about this. I had consoled to the extent of professionalism but that was all. I do feel bad for anyone who has lost a loved one, but she was 92. I can only feel sadness for someone briefly if they lived a long healthy life. I think if anything, that calls for a celebration.\n\nAnyways, so this guy is telling about the prices to go to India and how outrageous it is. I totally understand the stress of it all but then he asks me for a loan. He wanted about $500 to help him out. I immediately say no. I wasn't rude about it but I made it clear that I don't do that. I don't mind lending money to family and friends who I trust. A co-worker is a completely different story though. I just don't trust him. He may try to pull what the other supervisor did. All of it just seemed fishy. I wasn't interested in getting wrapped up in financial drama. Not to mention, it's two days after Christmas which is always a difficult time for most.\n\nHe was very upset with me for not even considering it. Because I'm the supervisor, I guess they think I make a lot more than them. But it's really not the case. I'm struggling like the rest of the working class.\n\nTo be honest, I don't think anyone should get mad at someone for not lending them money. You have the right to ask someone what ever you want. I just don't think you should expect things from people even during a trying time.\n\n\nEDIT: Thank you for all of your comments. Turns out the guy wasn't even going to India.

I also moved seats because she was annoying me. Last class, she gave me a brownie and I thought it was kind of like an “I’m sorry for being a dick” peace offering.

He is not my mother’s child, only my father’s. His real mother is a deadbeat. However if he came out I am certain my father would come around to it, only because over the years he’s gradually distanced himself from our old church because of how hateful the pastors’ associates have become toward gay people. It’s not an endorsement of their lifestyle, but it is a refusal to despise them. However he still thinks he has the right to deny baking a cake for them. \n\nI disagree with my father and my parents’ conservativeness, but have yet to vocalize said disagreements. I merely keep a safe distance since I’m in college. My brother however still tries to please them because I think he is conflicted. He still has Christian ideals and prays but his friends don’t share the same values (a lot of them are off the books weed/coke  dealers). He’s a bit of an alcoholic because of the fights he got into with our controlling parents growing up and I wouldn’t call him a deadbeat because he’s a very skilled manager at a retail store and did graduate college buuut all his free time is spent partying and abusing drugs as he tries to support his friends’ rap career (he’s apart of their group and frankly they suck. I wouldn’t disparage them if they didn’t pretend to be better than they are or ridicule me for being book smart, but the only person in their group that has a shot at making it is their producer because he can make beats in the style of many other producers. Lyrically speaking they need some help.)\n\nMy brother is a pretty macho fella. I am not. I do like sports, i play with my friends, but i don’t have as much muscle mass as him despite being toned/muscular myself. He used to bully me because he was treated as the problem child by my parents growing up but that all changed when i played sports in high school. I wouldn’t call him “nice,” but i would say he became invested in my athletic career and gave me helpful pointers, but it was primarily to preserve his reputation at our high school/college. His athletic career was the only way he could gain favor with my dad who served in the military. \n\nAs i mentioned earlier his friends are into drug abuse. He is heavily invested in a thuggish image that he maintains on his private instagram. He used to constantly pick on me for being a square and doing well in high school and college. I don’t resent him as much because I understand where he’s coming from and I’ve secretly been going to therapy for the last year to feel better about myself. I wouldn’t say I am at 100%, but I am far more confident than I used to be. Occasionally though i will be reminded of something he did and it’ll fuck up my whole day. (nitpicking my athletic performance in front of others, calling me gay as a kid cause I was into opera and Sailor Moon, criticizing me in front of our veteran of a dad when i wore brighter colors, belittling my interest in theater, etc.) One day he called me crying while drunk and apologized for being an asshole, but he hasn’t really changed much. He’ll still occasionally call me pansy or queer, despite my protests. I only know about him being gay because he opened up to me while under the influence, and told me “to never mention it again” when he sobered up. One of his friends mentioned it in front of me and he was pissed. \n\nAnyhoo, I attended a Christmas Eve family event and brought two friends. Word got around that I made the honor roll. He scoffed and rolled his eyes. My mother made a smart ass remark at my brothers’ expense. She said she meant it as a joke but it pissed him off. He glared at her and walked out. He returned a couple of hours later and talked to her privately, but he was drunk as fuck. I could tell by his staggering. She urged him to drink some water and sober up and he initially listened but couldn’t resist the call of my cousins playing basketball in the driveway. \n\nHe began to show off in front of my younger cousins. He was sloppy and unnecessarily aggressive. My cousins are 14, 16, and 17. I was already outside with my friends watching and we decided to go to one of their houses. My brother continuously taunted me as I left and threw the basketball at my head. I gave him the bird as I was slowly losing my cool then he continued to taunt me “cone here pussy, come play with me ya little queer” etc etc and I lost it. “Youre the only real queer around here.” He came at me but I ran away and all my friends and cousins subdued him. He cursed me as I got into my car and my dad and all the dudes came outside to find out what happened. He brushed it off and walked away. I haven’t talked to him since and he didn’t show up for Christmas breakfast. \n\nI really hate that I outted him but there’s a part of me that feels good about it. I finally hurt him. But I outted him in front of my cousins who I’m certain relayed the info to my uncle and father. Dads been pretty stern all morning. \n\nAITA? Could there have been a better way to go around this? He just makes me feel so weak and he’s projected his weakness and “”effiminacy”” on to me for so fucking long and it felt good to hurt him back. I just hate that it was at an inconvenient time for him and could mar his already shit relationship with our parents. Being closeted is more-so about survival than anything else and i feel like shit\n\nTLDR; My closeted bully of an older brother got mad at me at Christmas Eve dinner bc my mom showed off my academic success at his expense.

To say, after watching the San Junipero episode of Black Mirror, we said that if we ever end up alone in our 40s, we will date each other. \n\nThings between us have always been easy. We were at first a trio, but the other girl, L (30F), has been a true pain. She knew D for a couple of years longer, and has seen me like the intruder in a way. She acted like she was my friend, but then would tell D how I was toxic for her, when really she was the one who was toxic, and trying to be D’s only friend and making her her property in a way. \n\nThis didn’t put a strain in my relationship with D, and more so, reinforced it. We had each other’s back. \n\nTwo years ago, I went through a really tough break up, and at the time D had gotten into a relationship with a very manipulative guy. He would dictate her every move, and was all around a bad guy. I warned her, and told her to break it off. She didn’t really listen, as I was very much in the slump and couldn’t possibly rationalise it all with her. \n\nShe ended up breaking up in February 2017, which was a relief for me, but then she spent the entire year crying about how much of a monster he was, although I had warned her multiple times that he was sucking the life out of her. \n\nThings didn’t get better, when she found out she had a strain of HPV that gave her condylomas, and the timing matched with when she was with that guy. I did my best to be there for her, and reassure her that it wasn’t the end of the world. Offered to be with her when she went to the gynaecologist, and also when she went to get them lasered off. I listened to her on the phone hours at the time, when she cried because of him, thought she would never be able to be with someone ever again, and beating herself about it all. She had zero self esteem at that point. \n\nI did what any best friend would do, and explained to her that all of this wasn’t true, that she wasn’t worthless, and will find someone who will be beyond her expectations. \n\n\nAll through it all, she barely inquired how I was doing. I was going through a shit year, and except some times when I would break down in front of her, she was basically inexistant. Never asked how I was holding up, never offered to cheer me up. I get it. She was going through her own stuff, and I couldn’t hold her accountable for it. \n\nSo I sucked it up. \n\n\nAt the end of 2017, she started seeing this guy, who was initially trying to get together with me, but I rejected him over and over, because I was still hoping my ex would come back, and truly, he wasn’t my type personality wise. I need someone who is very active, quick witted, who can make me laugh, and who isn’t in some sort of half asleep state all the time. \n\nBut anyway, the guy didn’t want a relationship, and was just profiting off her state to get sex, basically living at her place and not spending a dime when helping with groceries or anything. She even did his laundry. FFS. What king of man child is that. \n\nHere again, I told her he wasn’t a good fit for her, that he used her as a surrogate mother who would also have sex with him. She didn’t listen. She needed the attention and told me it felt great that he would be here at night to stroke her hair. Fine. \n\n\nThen he started dropping the ball continuously. \nThey established they would have a sort of open relationship. Except he knew first hand that she wasn’t going to act on anything because she was unable to trust men anymore. He is very socially awkward and although not ugly at all he still scared people off because he’s just weird at first. He used her weakness to profit from the situation. They said that the rule was no telling. She didn’t want to hear about who he thought was attractive, or who he fucks. \n\nBut he mentioned one girl, even had her name in one of his passwords, called her by her name, you know the drill. \n\nShe kept coming to me crying saying that he fucked up again. At the time, I met my now boyfriend and was doing so much better, so I was ready to be her clutch again although she wasn’t mine for so long. So I listened, warned her, again and again, even had my boyfriend explain that as a guy he thinks his behaviour is unacceptable and so on and so forth. \n\nShe didn’t want to quit it. I told her that she didn’t need to come telling me about those things because it would just make me mad. She still did. And I still listened. \n\nA couple of weeks ago, she went on a trip, and she met this guy. They didn’t have sex, like no PiV but did everything around. I asked her why she didn’t go all the way when she recounted her nights with him, absolutely over the moon. And she said that she wasn’t allowed to “take off her clothes” when with someone else. Like. What ? She could do bj’s, get fingered, whatever else, but no PiV. I was mad. I didn’t know about this. How can you call this an open relationship ? Yeah you don’t. He’s profiting. Because she would excuse him for fucking someone all the way, but he would probably have thought it’s a deal breaker. Screw that. \n\nSince October, I’ve been very depressed. I can barely get out of bed. I can barely have sex with my boyfriend. I almost don’t eat anymore. Life is all together shitty. But yet again now, although I’ve told her, she doesn’t give a shit, or at least doesn’t try to be a friend to me. \nSo when she told me that her guy got upset because she “slept” with someone, I had enough. She was in tears saying that she fucked things up, and I told her I didn’t want to hear it. \n\nI went to leave, and she called me selfish. She doesn’t seem to realise that I have been suicidal, but I should somehow give a shit about her shitty relationship when I’m this down. \n\nI snapped at her and said that I don’t give a crap if she feels bad, because once again I warned her multiple times that this guy is a piece of work, and that she shouldn’t have agreed to anything with him if she wasn’t able to put up with it. \n\nNow I think our relationship is broken and there might be no going back unless she accepts that I’m also hurting in my own way, and have other things on my mind. She won’t apologise because she thinks I’ve overreacted, but I don’t see it. \n\nSo AITA for telling her to fuck off ? \n",

Everyone told me she was the worst but I tried to give her a chance anyways because I don’t like to judge people based off rumors. I tried to be nice at school but in the end she turned out to be exactly the person everyone told me she was (somewhat toxic, really narcissistic.) School finished and I never heard from her again. \n\nI got a job at my current location a few months ago, and X got hired where I work about a week ago. Since then she’s been causing a lot of problems. For example when the assistant manager called her out on charging too much and stealing products, X went straight to the manager and said she felt “attacked.” Most recently our manager created a “chore chart” for us. We don’t get paid to do these things. If it was stuff that I should be doing anyways like cleaning up after myself it would be fine but it’s things that take at least 1+ hour of time that I’m not getting paid to do.

I took responsibility for the call, and I didn’t use the incident as an excuse, I was just trying to explain to him what he kept asking me. A is usually empathetic, but that day, he didn’t even acknowledge the assault, and I felt like everything I was afraid of was coming true. He said I was making it all about myself. It’s been over a month, and he still hasn’t acknowledged the incident I told him about. \n\nWe got past it, but only with me profusely apologising. I know it was my fault, but it affected me. I have other serious mental illnesses, which often endanger me physically, but rn, I can’t trust him. \n\nMy ex, for all his manipulative ways, is great with words. He knows the tone to take with me that gets me into “little space”, where I give up all control and let him tell me what to do. Usually that’s hurtful, but in situations where I’m in physical danger, it works temporarily. \n\nBoth A and I have our exams, which are pretty important. I don’t want to talk to A about this rn, and I’m myself trying to just survive these exams. I’m quite stressed. I texted T everytime I felt unsafe, and he helped me out (he plays the ‘nice guy’ bit in my life, but he still has control/anger issues). I know my relationship with A won’t survive if I tell him about these conversations, which is why I plan not to, and instead get over the incident after the exams with my therapist’s help. I only text T out of self preservation, bec my therapist is not available right now. \n\nOfc it’s wrong, I’m just trying to figure out how much of an asshole I am in this situation. ",

Jokingly, I said “you should send those to X”. My friend actually sent them to her, and X called back sobbing and threatening to call the cops. \n     Y was understandably upset that I told her to send them, because I convinced her to send the photos and then she had to deal with X and her reaction. I thought Y knew about her phobia, and therefore wouldn’t send them to avoid triggering her. Y didn’t know, and sent her the photos because I told her to. I didn’t stop Y from sending the photos, but I didn’t really have much of a chance to as it was too late when I learned that she had actually sent them. The photos were very cartoonish and fake-looking, and I am having trouble believing that it would evoke such a response in her. X is known to overreact to everything and seek for attention. \n     The next day, I had a serious allergic reaction while I was running, and I started to go into anaphylactic shock. I had the worst itching of my life, my throat started to close up, I experienced the worse stomach cramps I’ve ever had, threw up multiple times, nearly shit myself, and I literally couldn’t walk so I had to be picked up in a truck by a park ranger and driven to the trail entrance so the ambulance could take me to the hospital. If it wasn’t for the two friends I had helping me and calling the park ranger, I could have died. The experience was traumatic for me and it took me a while to get over it. \n     I was still recovering from the physical symptoms of the allergic reaction when I heard X went around telling people that “going into anaphylactic shock was karma for what I did to her”. I can’t believe she thinks I deserve that for jokingly telling a friend to send her badly faked pictures of someone throwing up. I understand that phobias can be serious, but knowing her I feel like she overreacted and exaggerated her phobia for attention because that’s just the type of person she is. \n     Am I the asshole for telling Y to send those photos, even though I wasn’t serious?

She bought a cake, a bottle of tequila, made a fun quiz about me for the party and came up with what my flatmates should get me. I had a great time! I have social insecurities and felt very loved.

So I thought why not give it a try \nAt first I didn't find it amusing at all. I lost a couple of dollars and didn't think much about it. But when I got home from work I would always play for a small amount of money and one day a won a big price. (At least for me at that time). I think it was 500 dollar and that made me so happy because I really needed that money. Although I never cashed them out. I just continues playing until I lost it all again. After about a month or so I would put in all of my money to these online casinos and just continue to play until a lost it all. This quickly turned in to a bad habit and because my income was so low I almost didn't have enough cash for food. What i did was pretty stupid I know, but I was still a better option then to take a bunch of loans that would stack up.

They told me about it not being safe for me to go to school out of state, how I could get robbed, shot, or taken advantage of in a big city. They guilt tripped me about how bad they would feel if something were to happen to me, and said other things to try to make me reconsider my decisions.

This blindsided me so it's been pretty rough for me to accept, I was hoping she would at least try some marriage counselling or try and figure out what went wrong before I made a decision on if we should part ways but she wasn't interested and basically told me in no uncertain terms we would never get back together and to give up any hope of that. She is still with this guy today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo around this time last year, before the cheating was revealed, 2 of our closer friends invited us to their wedding, my wife is best friends with the Bride I was invited to be a Groomsman by the Groom and happily accepted. When we first broke up, I was talking to the Groom and pointed out that the wedding was going to be an issue, in my experience the bridal party are introduced to a song (we had picked our wedding song), dance together etc. He agreed and said he would actually understand if I couldn't go, but that I should definitely go to his bucks–a week long overseas trip. In January the Bride had her birthday and didn't invite me or mention anything, which kind of hurt. I put that aside and went to the bucks recently, had a good time with the buck.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn the weekend it was time to RSVP for the wedding and I'd been changing my mind back and forth often and thought maybe it was best if I avoided it all-together. The few times I've seen my ex when she has come to our house to pack her things, take the dog etc, I've found it really difficult to be around her so I've been avoiding any contact and removed her from social media to try and focus on moving on. I tried to call the groom to ask if my ex would be bringing her affair partner and to see what expectations there are for the bridal party. He didn't answer his phone so I sent a message basically saying that I regrettably won't be attending because of the situation with my ex-wife. In hindsight I probably should have kept trying to call him but I was really anxious about the call in the first place and just wanted it to be dealt with so I could try and relax. I haven't got a reply from him in 24 hours and I've tried to ring him several times today but he isn't answering, which is a bit unusual for him.

Now back in 2016 my brother and myself used to attend a youth service (I no longer go due to changed views but that's not important) where we met Jasmine, at that time she was attending the same Primary school as I was but I was only just starting to get to know her. She was also a bit of an \"odd\" person but I dont judge - we even became quite good friends. Fast forward about early 2018, Jasmine moves to a different town 15 minutes away after she's held back a year (so now shes my age but one grade behind). \n\nJasmine and I sort of drifted apart and I thought she was out of my life. Recently she suddenly started posting on her WhatsApp status out of nowhere, since I hadn't seen her online in over 2 months. These posts were all random deep and edgy quotes but amongst one of the slides was a picture of her and my brother in his room on his bed and they're all cuddled up and shit. My stomach honestly dropped and I just felt really sick to my stomach. It had to have been recently because 1. we moved into a new house and his walls are a bright colour so I could obviously see it was our new house and 2. he had recently dyed his hair which you could see in the image. \n\nI never remember her being invited to our house so I suspect he snuck her in which makes me even more ill.. I just cant believe he could do that. Everytime I look at a guy older than 17 I immediately associate it with my brother and am no longer interested. I'm honestly just really creeped out.\n\nSo in conclusion: Should I tell my mom? Or should I leave it because it's none of my business? I'm just super conflicted and could use some advice.",

A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used.

I've never felt more loved, happy, and fulfilled. \n\nI've always been into drugs (weed, coke, molly, etc) but my best friend/dealer managed to get his hands on heroin. I was an idiot who thought statistics didn't apply to me and I tried it. This was 7 years ago. I didn’t touch it again for almost a year until my birthday where I did it. That turned into using it on special occasions to using it weekly and to make a long story short, I became an addict.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy ex was an angel at that time and *pleaded* with me to get help. I thought I could handle quitting on my own. I couldn't admit to myself I needed help. My personality started changing. I would get irritable and scream at her. I would gaslight her (tell her I only used once that week knowing very well I was high all day everyday). I stole from her (not to mention my parents and friends). I was never physically abusive, but I was a piece of shit and look back in shame of what I was.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinally, after two years, she couldn't take it anymore and broke up with me. I was a mess. I was using a LOT more, stealing more, etc. I eventually OD’d and hit rock bottom.\n\nAfter my overdose, I knew that if I continued on this path, it WILL kill me. My withdrawal lasted for 10 days. It was hell on Earth, but I made it, and haven’t touched any drug since.\n\nI decided to turn my entire life around. I started volunteering at local schools (I worked with administration for local schools and was able to share my experience as an addict to kids), learned new skills to fill my resume gap. I got a job as a statistician a few months later (I majored in statistics in school) and now make decent money. I started working on myself, eating right, lifting, meditation, yoga. During the first couple years, it’s like I traded one addiction (heroin) with another (improving myself). I was scared shitless of becoming the failure I was destined to be in that lifestyle. I gained quite a bit of weight (muscle), look better than I ever had. I repaid every dime I ever stole (wrote them letters and checks individually).\n\nThe whole point of this context is to emphasize: I really have changed. I know I made shitty choices and I regret the person I was every day. \n\nI want to know, would I be the asshole if I reached out to her? I miss her everyday. She was my everything, my world. I’ve never had anybody else I was so happy with. When getting clean, my whole thought process was to become the man she wished I was. And now that I’m here, I just don’t know.

I really enjoyed our relationship and her as a person but I felt we couldn't keep dating anymore. We started dating about a year and half ago, before our senior year. It was fine and dandy until around graduation time. She was battling through depression and other mental issues (including an emotionally abusive mother and school stress). We went to prom together and she started pressuring me into having sex with her. It started as a joke but then she said if I really loved her then I would have it with her. And she started to say that about a lot of other things. I had my reserves because I was already starting to question our relationship, but that really made me question her intentions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter that, I felt like our relationship devolved from two best friends to me being her emotional crutch. The whole summer was just me taking care of her from one dilemma to the next. I loved her and was wanting to help so I overlooked a lot of it. But the final straw was when I went on a trip to Europe as my grad present. I saved money for two years by working in fast food for this trip and was super excited. My ex was not going on the trip from going on another trip the summer before. I was only able to talk to her a few times over the trip because of the cellular reception. Every time we talked, she just talked about how jealous that I was on the trip. She never even asked me what I did on the trip. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I came back from the trip, I decided to confront her about how I wasn't happy. When I did, she broke down crying and was angry that I never told her all these things bothered me. So I backtracked and decided on a break. We talked less for about a week then got coffee right before we moved in to college. She seemed like she was really trying to be better and wanting me to be happy so I thought getting back together would be fine.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen we moved in to college, everything just felt the exact same between us. So I finally just ended it for sure this time a week in. It really hurt the both of us. And every day after that, I was thinking about her. So about a month later, I texted her to get coffee and try to get back together. We met, she showed up with two massive hickies on her neck (that kinda hurt). We talked about college and life. She told me about all the new guys she's been with and I sheepishly avoided my lack of moving on. We finally talked about us, and she told me that I broke her and I was an asshole for not communicating. She then said she never loved me, which I knew was a lie but still hurt. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel terrible for leaving her in such a bad state during the first semester of college, but some of my friends are college have said though that she is being manipulative.

We got each other little gifts when we saw something the other person would like and frequently went out on dates. Nothing fancy, just a nice walk or playing video games at each other's houses.\n\nThere were a few things I couldn't really stand though. My ex was really passionate about DnD and when we were hanging out or on a date he'd go on for hours about the game. I do enjoy playing the game but he never gave me a chance to speak and would keep going until I eventually got so bored I made an excuse to leave. \n\nHe was also very clingy. I have an aversion to physical contact and have a hard time even hugging family members. He would always try to hug me whenever he saw me or give me a kiss on cheek. Ive told him multiple times I don't really like physical contact but he never stopped. \n\nHe would also get super paranoid when I didn't answer his texts. If he texted me and I didn't respond within an hour he'd text me again and again, getting more frantic with each passing minute. An example was when I was helping my grandmother tend to her garden because she was old and couldn't take proper care of it anymore. After two hours of pulling weeds and placing mulch down I took a break and checked my phone to notice over 20 texts from him asking where I was and what I was doing. This happened constantly. \n\nTRIGGER WARNING FOR THE TOPIC OF ABUSE \nI REPEAT TRIGGER WARNING FOR MENTIONS OF ABUSE\n\nOn my birthday I had my then bf and two mutual friends over so we could hang out and go to a local carnival. We talked and went on rides and stuff. I worked as a camp counselor then and one of my friends worked at a daycare. We shared stories about the kids and the stuff they did that got them in trouble. My bf then said \"If a kid misbehaved I would hit them to teach them a lesson.\" I was shocked and replied, \"You shouldn't hit a kid, it's not good for their development and won't teach them anything.\"\nWe got into an argument over whether or not it was okay to beat a child instead of any other form of punishment. He didn't think that telling them what they did was wrong would good enough and the only way to properly teach them a lesson was to literally beat it into their head. \n\nI broke up with him a week later and he got super depressed, talking about how I was the only girl who ever gave him a chance and how perfect I was. I got a message a few days ago from him saying he still had feelings for me.\n\nSome friends have told me that I'm in the wrong for dumping him because we did get a long great and that one incident shouldn't have made me break up with him. \n\nAm I in the wrong?",

We live in neighboring states and see one another about once every three weeks. \n\nShe's currently a lawyer and has been studying for the bar in my state. We talked about living together, a future together, ect when we finally moves to the city where I live. This was her plan before we ever met.\n\nShe's currently working double court room (double the normal work load without any incentive) and studying for the bar full time. She warned me prior to her studying that she can get grumpy and become emotionally irrational at times. It's stressful. \n\nI've been supportive. We talk daily. I bought her premade meals to be delivered weekly so she doesn't have to worry about cooking dinner and studying. I've spent hours on FaceTime asking her test questions to help her prepare.\n\nFor Valentine's day I sent her a care package, a card, and a nice text early in the morning. Unfortunately she was having a shitty day at work. I listened to her complaints and frustrations. Did my best to validate her feelings. At one point during the day I FaceTimed her just to say hi. She seemed busy and I told her I missed her but I will let her get back to work. She became annoyed that I was ending the conversation and hung up on me.  I texted her back and said \"I know you wouldn't appreciate it if I hung up on you, I'd like the same consideration as well. I'm sorry you're having a rough day at work\".\n\nThe rest of the day goes by and that evening I was disappointed that she had not said or done anything for me on Valentine's day. We have always had a policy of, if something is bothering you, communicate it so we can fix it. So I did, exactly the way she claims she likes to be communicated with.\n\n\"I just want to let you know that I'm a little disappointed about today. I felt like you didn't say or do anything for me on Valentine's day. It just hurts a little bit\".\n\nInstead if validating my feelings she tells me that I shouldn't expect anything from her while she's so stressed with the exam. That Valentine's isn't a big deal. She then starts to claim that I'm making her feel like a shitty girlfriend and she doesn't need that stress right now, a week before her test. We end up not talking the rest of the night. \n\nIn the morning I get the message \"hey, we need to talk. I don't think this is going to work out\". I was shocked she wasn't apologizing or at a minimum validating my feelings. I told her  she could have at least sent a sweet message or told she missed me.

		"story": "TW: mention of sexual assault/rape\n\nIt's been a hectic couple of days\n\nBasically, I had to sit down and come to terms with the fact that my home situation is exasperating my depression and anxiety. Long story short, my dad is a narcissist and my mom is heavily depressed but has accepted her situation and tries to minimize things; even though both of them say they want the best for me and care about me, I feel stifled in a lot of ways- I have a strict curfew, friends are vetted, I have to deal with my dad's temper and be careful to not do anything to upset him. \n\nLast year he threatened to kill me and honestly, I haven't felt safe around him since even though he joked that \"it's just how he is\". (I didn't call the cops because I have a younger sister and didn't want to deal with CPS again. When I was a sophomore he also made a \"joke\" about not needing a gun to kill my mom, sister, and I and told my therapist, who was a mandated reporter. My mom and sister were mad at me for telling my therapist that and it was just a stressful time) \n\n I think that getting some distance (just not living under the same roof) with my parents would help our relationship in the long run and let me just recover from stuff that's happened. I am 18 and will be turning 19 soon- I have job experience, and a fair amount of money saved up as well as a network of people I can stay with. I made the decision to leave relatively quickly, as in it was in the span of a couple of days. It might seem a little silly, but the main catalyst was that I wanted to go to have a sleepover at my friends house, and my dad immediately went on a tirade on how \"we don't know these people\", that I was going to be raped in my sleep by my friend's father, that I was being spoiled, etc. My mom wanted me to try to have a conversation with him, but I think those familiar with /raisedbynarcissists knows how difficult it is.\n\nThen my mom said that being 18 doesn't mean that you're an adult. She felt bad, because she said that she'll talk to my dad and tell him if I answer her texts and can drop by something to check out the house then I'll be safe. The sleepover was okay, but I just ended up stressing over about my mom stopping by and being taken home that I ended up feeling shitty. \n\nAnother thing that pushed me was that my mom said my dad supposedly got a tip that I was seen with a guy, or hanging out with a guy, and she was questioning me over a couple of days. I honestly think maybe she saw something, and is just trying to get me to tell her what's going on (I've always been kinda shy telling her about my friends). \n\nI packed a bag, was dropped off somewhere, and after a couple of hours called my mom to tell her that lately things at home have been stressing me out, and I need a couple of days to clear my head, and that I'll contact her soon.\n\nLet me put what happened in bullet points to be concise\n\n* said that I can go spend the night at my grandma's house, that my mom can book me a hotel, or that we can go apartment hunting together as long as she knows where I am at all times (not necessarily a bad idea, but I still wanted some time to myself, and was extremely skeptical because I don't think dad would've been on board- for a decision like that, he'd give a lot of pushback. If it's okay for me to be a little mean, she hasn't shown that she's strong enough to set boundaries with him)\n* started yelling at me \n* said that she was going to find the address of my boyfriend and show up to his house by using Facebook\n* texted me about our \"home situation\" and that we have to maintain it (like isn't that a euphemism for abuse??) \n* went to the bookstore I used to work at and told my friend and I was missing \n* went to the friend's house I spent the night in and got her mom to come to my friend's job and said that she was going to call the police to find me (I called them ahead of time and told them I'm not a missing person, and explained my family situation a bit)\n\nI've been trying to lay low, but I've been feeling a lot of guilt from my family and from myself. From all of the calls and texts I've gotten, they're not mad but are just really worried. My uncle actually reached out and said I can stay with him and he doesn't have to tell my parents, that he's worried I'll be taken advantage of. My grandma has been crying because she's convinced something terrible happened to me, and my family isn't telling her\n\nI have a boyfriend, and since **they have access to my call history and my text logs** they probably know about him. So that's extremely embarrassing :( I love him and he's been really strong and supportive through all of this, and even though I should not worry about this right now, they probably think he manipulated me into leaving if they went through that deep. \n\nRight now, my plan is to just stay hidden, call my grandma to tell her I'm still alive and love her, and just do damage control while moving into my new place soon. \n\nAnyway, I tried to do my best to explain what the last three days of my life have been. Am I an asshole for leaving?? Could I have handled things better? I honestly did not expect **this.** I never said I was running away or never wanted to see them, but I stated plainly that I'm not happy with the way things are at home and needed my own privacy for a couple of days.\n\ntldr; family is Pakistani Muslims who had a collective meltdown to me leaving home and going low contact for a couple of days. didn't want to sit down and tell them because I knew they would shut me down immediately from personal experience. am I an asshole for stressing everyone out?",

Whether it be because she hangs out with her a lot or how my roommates hate her, her BFF always come up.   \nThis time I was on the phone with my girlfriend while a different friend was in the background. I don't remember how, but the conversation turned into why are you so obsessed with my BFF? do you like her? do you want to sleep with her? why do you think about her all the time? and not in the kind of way where you feel like they are asking genuinely but she was asking on the attack being pissed off thinking I actually do care about her BFF in some sort of sexual way. Her friend in the background chimed in agreeing, yeah maybe he likes her too which got me more flustered. I immediately responded with no I would never sleep with someone 300 pounds. I said this to her in confidence, I thought her BFF would never hear it, I said it to her to get to stop thinking I liked her friend.   \n\n\nCut to now my relationship, it having its problems, she says I disrespect the people she loves and I call her friends fat and that shes going put this on public and I can see how many people think I was wrong for even commenting on someone's weight. It was ONE time, and the only reason her friend knows is because my girlfriend told her.  \nMy response is go for it, I said what I said defending myself and I had no ill intentions. I don't think her friend is 300 pounds and if it was meant to be disrespectful it would of been. She doesn't see any wrong in telling her friend what I said, I should be able to trust and talk to my girlfriend.   \nThis is my first post so let me have it, I don't think I'm the guy shes painting me to be, a rude unloving judgmental person because I defended myself.

Her last ex boyfriend, a really good guy, she left for my stepdad.\n\nMy stepdad is in debt, emotionally and mentally abusive, grumpy, mean, has a credit score of 583, is extremely quick to anger, obsessively neat and orderly and exact and does routines to the point where there's DEFINITELY something wrong there (can't drink out of any other cup, won't sit down if someone is using *his* chair, paces around the house at night in an exact way, gets irrationally angry if anything is out of place).\n\nHer ex was so sweet, kind to me, and her, and the deer and wild animals that lived near his house like a Disney princess. He had an amazing job, didn't come home burnt out, was pretty wealthy, patient, loved all of us, and was just... Great. I miss him.\n\nI was 6 when she started dating my stepdad, and I repeatedly told her I didn't like him. I remember this over a decade later. She made me come with her to his house, where we did nothing, I had nothing, it was overall boring as shit. She wouldn't let me stay at my grandma's house where we lived.\n\nOne day, my hamster got very sick. He was definitely going to die while I was gone. She forced me to come with her, even though my grandma said she would love to watch me. So I was dragged into the car and we drove there, while I cried my eyes out because I had to leave my dying pet alone with my grandma. He died over that weekend and I didn't get to hold him in his last moments, instead he died scared and alone.\n\nHe constantly degrades me, calls me bitch, cunt, asshole, basically all of that. Whenever I do something a little wrong, I get screamed at. Or if he thinks I did it. If my mom did it, he doesn't yell.  My mental health plumetted at 7 the fuck years old because of his constant assholery.\n\nThe only times he was ever nice to me were the times I tried to kill myself. He's sent me into panic attacks constantly, then screams like a child when I WAS a child. He's 40+ years older than me.\n\nHe is... \"Inexperienced\" with kids. Youngest child, never had kids, little cousins, nieces or nephews, etc. He treated me like a short adult, not a kid.\n\nHe also never acknowledged my disability. I'm autistic, and he fought me constantly on it, saying I'm just lazy/stupid/overreacting. ~~How am I overreacting but you screaming at me because there's water on the sink is fine and mature?!??~~ I have a few things wrong with me, including ADHD, bipolar, cptsd (from him), etc. \n\nMy mom has seen all of it. It's not a secret. Since I was little I didn't like or trust him. I didn't want him in my life. But she never wavered, just went along with my screaming and crying and begging to stop because I HATED him, and ended up marrying him.\n\nI know some of you will say \"just move out\". I'm disabled. I have tried to get a job, every single one I've ever applied to threw out my application or something because half I never even got a call back. I've applied to over 80 places within 20 miles of me. (Yes of course I called and they said it was rejected, I asked why they never say why, they say they don't know).\n\nMy mom calls me selfish for still holding a grudge for it. And they both gang up on me and blame me for everything. My therapist who's heard both sides of the story told my mom that SHE is/was in the wrong anyway. She also calls me lazy after I do everything for her because she's physically and mentally disabled because I'm tired after going to school for 6 hours dealing with animals and taking care of them for free.\n\nTl;dr AITA for hating my abusive stepdad who my mom married even though i constantly said I hated him and her seeing the abuse,(I liked her past boyfriend so you can't say that everyone hates their stepparents)  blaming my mom, and trying to commit suicide and self harmed multiple times because of him?

So i get there as soon as possible only to see the worker closing off the gas station. I headed to the nearest station that had gasoline but E10 was all they had left.

		"story": "TLDR Broke w/ GF of 6 years, but we remained on good terms, started dating another one three days later and new gf said she won’t keep it going unless I cut off ex totally. Ex was devastated when I cut her off. The story happened 3 days b4 ex’s birthday and when on birthday her friend called me on whatsapp saying ex was having a breakdown and needed me to comfort her, I hung up and blocked that friend’s number. Gf made things worse by updating her IG and I let that slip too. AITA?\n\nWhen I went to college I started dating a girl from my study group and... well, it’d been a rocky relationship to say the least. I’ll elaborate in last in comments, if needed but for now I believe this info isn’t crucial for the story.\n\nEnd of year 6 and I meet the other girl. We went to the bar once, next day I went to business trip in which I decided to dump my gf for good which was long overdue and then take a shot with that girl. The day I come back I break up with ex and she handles this surprisingly well, not crying or screaming as I expected but wishing me good riddance. Three years later I date the new girl who seems perfect in every way.\n\nAnyway, since our breakup was amicable, I didn’t cut off my ex like I used to do. We kept texting and she would often call me to have a chat. I never planned to get back together because I was more than happy with my gf, but out of respect for the six years I kept helping her during her breakdowns, consoling ger when she was complaining about how she will never find another boyfriend and she wants to love like it’s her favourite song and I talked her through it. My gf knew I dated someone for 6 years and she knew I’m on good terms with my ex and I thought it was ok because she herself remained friends with her ex and it never made me jealous. She never knew the nature of our conversations with ex though. \n\nLast week I went out for snacks leaving gf alone at my apartment and when I came back she was unhappy to say the least. Turns out, I left my laptop open and she saw an incoming message from an ex with sonething like ‘I’m feeling blue again, let’s talk’. She dug through our message history and said that she thinks I’m still up to smthng w/ my ex because we speak very intimately. I said that theres nothing sexual/romantic going on between us but she didn’t believe and said she needed time think it over.\n\nNext day we met and she said she was really into me to the point that she surprises herself, so she is willing to give me benefit of the doubt on condition that I stop communicating with ex whatsoever. Not even asking anything work-related (we’re employed in similar fields). I agreed. She was surprised, saying I knew her for a few weeks and I’m already forgetting about a girl that I loved for 6 years. I said that my ex is my past and my gf is my present and hopefully future. She seemed still confised but we decided to give it another chance. Then she also asked me to tell my ex I have a new gf before cutting her off. I said I was hesitant to do it because it would wreck her. She saud she “couldn’t give two flying turds about what [my] ex would feel as well as [I] didn’t give two turds about [her] feelings while calling [my] ex pet names”. I reluctantly agreed. \n\nNext time my ex called me I told her I had a new GF and boy did it go bad. She started crying and calling me a jerk and saying my gf is ugly (I didn’t tell her the name but her friend probably told her who that was after seeing us together in a parking lot). I said I no longer want to contact her and hung up. That was January 23rd. Her birthday is on Jan 26th. And it was also the Homecoming day in our college. I couldn’t attend but I dropped my girlfriend off and when she went out to get tea, I wandered around the hall to say hi to people I knew. Now, to make it clear. They had some kind of a concert so everyone sat down at the conference hall. I noticed a guy I went to hockey team with, sitting in the seat on the edge and started small talk with him. What I didn’t notice was that my ex was sitting just behind him. When my girlfriend entered, she saw me going down the stairs from my ex’s general direction. She didn’t say anything but the seat behind my ex was empty and gf used that opportunity to sneak on her texting.\n\nIt went like this. \nEx, texting me: why did you ignore me? It’s my birthday and you didn’t even congratulate\nMe: I didn’t see you\nEx: I was waiting for you so much, I even wrote a poem to you\nMe: Stop, Holding. That. Against me.\nEx: Ok, I’ll get to the caffeteria  now.\nMe, still in the building, thinking of a cup of coffee to go: which one?\nEx: the one on the 2nd floor.\n\nSo I avoid 2 floor and get coffee on ground floor. That was all our messaging. When I pick up my gf from the Homecoming, she’s infuriated. She is screaming because she saw my texts to ex and we made an agreement before that. I’m trying to say that I was trying to get off the convo and there’s a good reason I used iMessages - cause she is blocked everywhere else. GF don’t wanna hear, she says it didn’t look like rejection and was all like  “You. Talked. To. Her.” It took me three hours to convince her not to cut our relationship right here and by that moment we were in my apartment and 1 hour later had consensual make-up sex. \n\nBefore we ended arguing, she said that she doesn’t want me to talk to my ex in any circumstances at all, not even telling her to get away from me. So, she is in the shower and I get a phone call from my ex’s roommate and she’s like “OP, it’s [ex name] birthday and she can’t stop crying because of you, could you please talk to her for a while?” I said no and hung up and blocked her number. Then I received an e-mail fron ex’s address saying she just wants to talk it out one last time so she’s comin to my place. \n\nThis is where my girlfriend comes out of the shower asking who called me and I tell her everything as is. Then I unblock the roommate and ask her to convince my ex not to do that because I’m not there and it’s a remote suburb area and she doesn’t know the address cause I only recently moved in. Roommate says ok. Girlfriend, knowing ex is stalking her IG takes a snap of the view from my window, posting it with a location (and nobody else me or ex of gf know lives here) and writes “this is gonna be one hot night”. When I asked her why would she do that, she said that my ex’s behavior made her cry so she’s gonna make her cry twice as hard. I should have been bothered by that and her reading my messages (she herself admitted that was messed up), but I just couldn’t bring myself to, despite her behavior deeply hurting the person I loved for 6 years. \n\nAITA for the way I treated my ex?\n\n\n",

I was part way through the fall semester of my sophomore year and as per usual during that time high school homecomings were coming up. I had been setting up plans with my girlfriend at the time (a senior) on the events that would occur. Where we were eating, pictures, etc. After plans were put in place, I started to question if I was happy in the relationship. While not an extreme distance apart, it was still a fair commute. On top of the stresses and new experiences that college was offering I was finding that it wasn't worth sacrificing my happiness to remain in this relationship. However, I came to this conclusion just about a week before homecoming. At this point I was torn, I could've easily called her to let her know, but suddenly all the plans that were in place would fall apart and she would be left without a date on short notice. I could also just try to let her have one last week of happiness and then let her know after the dance. Out of these I chose door number 2 because i had already made a commitment to these plans and felt obligated to follow through with them.   \n\n\nSo the week goes by and I head home to prepare for the festivities. I do my best to act like nothings wrong. We go to dinner with some of her friends, have some laughs, eat decent food. Then we start making our way to the school. Apparently I'm not as good at acting as I thought, and she started to ask some questions. The usual, \"Are you OK?\", \"Is everything alright?\", and then finally as we pull into the parking lot and put my car into park she asks me in a scared voice \"Are you breaking up with me?\" In that moment I knew I was fucked. I had to answer honestly because if I lie and break up with her afterwords I'm a piece of shit. I told her that I didn't want it to happen like this, that i wanted her to have one last night where everything was alright and then tell her. Looking into her eyes I could see the pain she was feeling and I couldn't do anything to help in that moment.

She works hard, is honest, and the customers like her because she likes to have a lot of small talk. I usually don't mind it either, what bothers me about her is that she touches me without my permission (I've told her not to), blatantly interrupts things I'm doing to tell me some boring, long story that I don't care about, and often interjects herself into conversations that are completely unrelated to her. It seems like she doesn't comprehend the idea that people don't care about her stories or her anecdotes even though they visibly seem annoyed or bored with it. Last night everything ended up coming to a head. For context, I have a dissociative disorder that's typically brought on by stress. I run on autopilot and end up with a lot of my actual thinking being more drawn into trying to recover. When this comes up, I go off to do dishes alone to help recover until it's time for me to take a drive. She decided she wanted to help me out, and I told her \"No, it's fine.\" No one at my work knows about my condition.\n\nShe didn't budge, but I was in no position to argue as my mind began to disconnect. She started rambling, and I was tuning her out while I phased in and out of reality like I was an ethereal being. I was trying to ground myself. Eventually she poked me kinda hard and my body recoiled, I just stared at her like 'what the hell?' She asked if I'd heard her, and I shrugged, telling her, that I would if she had anything of value to listen to. She was offended, naturally and called me rude and told me that I should at least listen to what she's saying. She proceeded to shove my shoulder lightly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI decide it's time for the hard truth. I explained to her bluntly, that her touching me made me incredibly uncomfortable because she's my coworker, not my girlfriend. I went on to tell her that her anecdotes and stories weren't interesting in the slightest and that her obnoxious humming to the store music grated on everyone who could hear it. I finished by telling her that she wasn't terrible to be around, but that it'd be great if she was self aware enough to understand that people find her really annoying and if she could recognize that she'd be much more tolerable. I was frustrated with her, honestly, fed up with the touching and her constant babbling about bullshit that was always stacked onto stress from rush hours or from being incredibly tired and not wanting to deal with her. She just was so obliviously unaware of people despite the fact that we were visibly tired and vocal with our feelings. I just kinda let it all out on her and part of me felt bad because it was harsh, but I felt like it was necessary to make her understand.

We were in a tourist-heavy city walking around and taking in the views. Unfortunately, while walking around, she started getting light-headed. She pricked her finger to test her blood sugar and saw it was a fearful 41. Additionally, as far as she recalls, that is the lowest her blood sugar had ever been as well. For those unfamiliar, while it varies person-to-person, anything under 70 is considered very bad. Usually it results in the form of dizziness, weakness of muscle, and a slew of other bad symptoms. Even worse yet, she didn't realize it until we were in the moment, but she didn't have anything to bring up her blood sugar either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOur options were limited, but thankfully, we were right next to a McDonald's and we figured it would be easy to go in, grab a soda, and bring her blood sugar up. Needless to say, it didn't quite go as expected. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is where my assolhery comes into question. We got inside and all the lines were long and the room was flooded with people. I sat my wife down at a table at their bar area and skipped to the front of the line. I frantically asked if I could have a cup for a soda, as my wife is diabetic, and that I would gladly pay after she can bring her blood sugar up. The employees, as well as everyone I skipped in line, seemed noticeably irritated at me at this point. The employee agreed to giving me the cup, but I would have to pay first, as it was policy. I quickly explained that this was urgent and that my wallet was in the backpack my wife had, but he was having none of it. I ran over, grabbed my wallet from the backpack, and went back to the front of the line. As all the employees were tied up taking orders, I waited what felt like minutes (but in reality was maybe a minute or two) for them to finish up so I could purchase the soda. As he rang me up for the soda, admittedly, I angrily and loudly was expressed my disgust with the way they handled the situation. In retrospect, most everyone in the restaurant probably thought I was an asshole.

The one game that we all have in common is League of Legends, which as those who have played it know, an incredibly frustrating game if taken too seriously. Most of us are fine with losing, because in the end we have fun regardless, but one of my friends clearly takes the game far more seriously than us, and after losing one or two games, regardless of how many we've won before, he'll quit the Discord server and leave.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, I have no problem with people who take the game seriously. It often leads to them trying very hard to win, which is fine because I like winning as much as the next guy. But this friend, he just completely shuts down, doesn't talk to anyone for hours, and is just demoralizing/disappointing when this happens.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast night was the last straw for me. He loaded into the game late, which resulted in him being slightly behind compared to our enemies. After playing for a few minutes and dying a couple of times, he left the game, the voice channel, and we didn't hear from him until the morning after, which is when the A-holery began. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not particularly confrontational, so I never know what to say in these types of situations, which is why I think I may have come off as way more rude than I intended. When I told him about how pissed I was the night before because he just left the game, essentially ruining everyone else's fun, and guaranteeing that we'd lose in a 4v5, he went silent and left as usual. I then messaged him, saying that I get that he's an emotional person and takes this type of stuff at heart, but it's a f'ing game, and if he gets this upset over losing he should just stop playing, because otherwise he ruins the fun for everyone else.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA? Although I don't regret telling him what I told him, I kind of regret the way I told him, which might have been a bit too aggressive. I understand why he does it, but I also firmly believe that if given the choice of playing a game that might make you upset and just not risking it and not playing, he should definitely not play. On top of that, if you have to suffer through a 20 minute game which you hate to avoid pissing off and ruining the fun for 4 other people, 1 or 2 of which are your actual irl friends, you should do it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, tell me Reddit, AITA?",

The reason we are long distance is because he got into a great teaching program in Japan (I am in the US). Once complete, he plans on coming home and marrying me. I have been keeping tabs on his recently added friends on Facebook. He has recently added some girls from his program. I am not a jealous type or anything and it is fine for him to meet other people, in fact I want him to enjoy a social life while away from me. While he has been away I decided to better myself by losing weight, eating healthy and attending a community college program. I am still living at home with my parents and have been working a job at a marketing company to help support the family. Money is tight, I feel like I need to be careful when purchasing anything. \n\nFor me to get to and from my job at the marketing company and then to the community college at night, I have to take public transportation. It is not glamorous, it is what I need to do. I know that my boyfriend will be making a decent salary as a teacher when he comes back to the US, but in the meantime, I have to take busses. Any time I am in public, I am at risk for a male talking to me. I disclose any flirtatious actions from men to my boyfriend as soon as it happens. So, I can usually tell the difference when someone is flirting versus making small talk. Well there was a nice underprivileged teenager that was riding with me and asked for my number. I clarified that I had a boyfriend and he said that he just wanted to be friends. So, I added him on snapchat to continue the dialogue in a similar way to how my boyfriend has been adding Japanese girls. I did not do this out of spite, but rather to try and be supportive if needed as his family is less supportive than mine. \n\nAnyways, I told my boyfriend once he woke up that I met a new friend on the bus and how I added him. He did not take this well. At all. He started screaming at me and accusing me of cheating on him. I felt like this was very unfair since I have been so supportive and trusting of his life while he has been away. He threatened to break up with me and instead I was able to push for us to go on a break instead. I didn’t do anything with anyone while we weren’t talking for three weeks. We just talked again last night, and I didn’t want to bring up other people because I thought it might trigger his distrust. I assumed that my boyfriend also had been loyal, but my heart was aching to know. He ended up bringing it up in a roundabout way and I told him that it was none of his business because he is the one that wanted the break. Anyways this resulted in him screaming at me.

This wasn't my fault-- The mold was behind a large, heavy bookcase which none of us could move, and we only noticed when it creeped out from behind said bookcase onto the open wall. Uh oh.\n\nSo, my mother decided that she has to move the giant bookcase anyway, she might as well rearrange my room. I protested, but she made it clear it was happening whether I wanted to or not. So, I stayed home from school to help her move the various bookcases and dressers in my room, since she often has trouble doing that on her own and I'm not so callous to let my mother get a hernia moving things. \n\nThen, my mother brings out the new bed. Now, for more context: My bed was a memory foam mattress on the floor. Rudimentary, I know, but it's always been comfortable, and I've slept relatively well. My mother doesn't approve of this, citing that I'm close to the floor, and that's why I get sick so much. \n\nNow, she asked the question earlier if I wanted her to get the bed. I refused adamantly. See, the new bed isn't as much of a bedframe as it is a large air mattress, easily the size of two normal mattresses in height. \n\nSo she brought it in and pumped it full while she said I could take a break, seeing as all the heavy lifting was done. So, I come back and she's making the bed for me, and having trouble. Once again, she won't let it go, so I help her. As an afterthought, she puts my previous mattress on top of the air mattress with a single sheet on it, before laying down and claiming it's the most comfortable bed she's ever been in. \n\nI do the same, and no. No, it's not. I sink deep in, I hate air mattresses, and I know I can't sleep on it. This is the part where I think I might be TA. After she set it up and I told her twice it wasn't comfortable and I didn't like it, she went to bed. \n\nI'd like to say I tried, but I need to get up tomorrow, the only pump to make it more taut is electric and it makes a lot of noise and I can't do that as everyone else is asleep, and that mattress just won't work for me even if I do. I did try to get the hang of it while I was awake, but I could barely sit, and lying down anywhere but the centre sent me tumbling off.\n\nSo, I deflated the bed. I didn't pop it, mind you, I just opened the cap and let all the air out. My mother doesn't yet know I did this, but I know she'll be **pissed** when she finds out. She said she spent upwards of $70 on it, and that she liked it, why can't I? \n\nI love my ma, but she's stubborn and I can't do this anymore.

Around 11 she tells me that she’s hungry and I tell her to go ask her dad for lunch because it’s around lunch time. She comes back up stairs a while later and I assume that she ate. Comes 12, she asks me again to give her something to eat and I finally go downstairs to give her something to eat.\n\nI get downstairs and asks her what she wants to eat and her dad then asks me what I’m doing. I say I’m giving her something to eat, it’s lunch time. He tells me that he knows what time it is but she can’t eat yet because she threw away part of her bagel this morning and all she does is waste food. At this point I get really snarky because there’s plenty of built up tension that has been around for *years* along with the fact that she barely ate breakfast, it’s been four hours, and she ate dinner around 7. I ignore him and keep asking her what she wants to eat and he tells her she needs to go upstairs in her room. \n\nI explain to him that she rarely eats bagels, so the fact that she wouldn’t eat all of it isn’t surprising. He then blames that on my mom because my mom fixed breakfast for her. (My mom works nights and is basically running on autopilot 75% of the time).\n\nI tell her that she doesn’t have to go upstairs because I’m going to fix her lunch. \n\nIt then gets out of hand because he asks me who I think I’m talking to and I tell him I’m obviously talking to him.

		"story": "Background info: My family has a long tradition of drinking socially together; it's a very acceptable practice in our culture as well. Whenever my adult siblings, parents, and I get together we almost always have a few cocktails together and talk and laugh and have a merry time. None of us will drive if we're impaired and we won't allow anyone else to drive if they've been drinking. \n\nIt's also common knowledge in my family that me and all of my siblings drank when we were underage. In my country the legal drinking age is 21. My parents would often give us a glass of wine with dinner when we were younger or if they were hosting a party they would often let us drink some wine or beer. They most likely knew that when we were teenagers we were drinking at parties with friends, but they turned a blind eye to that. \n\nNow my brother has two sons. He is very strict with them and tries very hard to control every aspect of their lives, not to be a dick, but because he really wants them to be safe. One of his sons, Ian, who is 17, has often expressed to me his frustration at how strict his dad is and how he feels like he can't do a lot of fun things that his friends get to do. A typical teen-aged complaint, I think. \n\nI've always been the \"cool aunt\" to all of my nieces and nephews and because of that they have an adult to turn to when they want to talk about things their parents may not approve of like sex or drinking. Ian has confided in me about how he has to lie to his dad (my brother) about where he goes out with his friends because my brother won't let him go to parties. Ian also likes to tell me about the fun he's had drinking with his friends. I always tell him to be careful and to never drive drunk and to never let a friend drive drunk. But I also laugh with him and share in the fun he has in telling me his \"going out drinking with the boys\" stories. \n\nSo my brother and his fam live in a completely different part of the country than I do and we only see each other on holidays a couple of times per year. So during the last holiday that they visited, we were all gathered at my parents' home. Everyone was there - my three siblings and all of their kids (in their 20s) and me and my husband and my parents. Everyone was getting pretty lit and drinking and laughing except for Ian who's only 17. So on the sly I asked him if he wanted me to make him a drink and he said yes. So I made him a vodka...and then another....and then another. Keep in mind that we were at the home of my parents, no one was driving that night as we were all planning on crashing there. No guests outside of family members were present, and we had no plans to go anywhere else that night. \n\nAs the evening progressed Ian started acting tipsy. Everyone, including his mum, noticed and thought is was funny. They figured out that I must've given him some drinks. My brother was the very last person to catch on. When he did figure it out, Ian told him that I had given him the alcohol. My brother was fuming mad at me, but we didn't talk about it because it was late and everyone just wanted to crash. In the morning my brother and his fam all left early to drive back to their home a few hours away.\n\nThe next week a get a call from my brother and he was absolutely livid that I gave Ian some drinks. He went on and on about how Ian had never tasted alcohol before I gave him some that night and that now his son is corrupted because of me and also how I've undone all the great parenting he and his wife have done with Ian and that because of me he's now destined to be some sort of hoodlum (he's at the top of class and a stellar student btw). He went on to say that I have no boundaries and that I've been undermining his family for years (not sure how since we've never lived in the same part of the country since he's had kids?). And now because of what I did, my brother has chosen to remain very distant towards me. He continues to hold it against me that I gave Ian alcohol. He doesn't invite me to his home anymore for holidays, though he'll invite the rest of my family members. My other siblings still maintain a relationship with him, but they almost keep it secret from me because they know that my brother doesn't talk to me socially anymore or invite me to his home, and I'm guessing they don't want me to feel bad.\n\nI realize that I exhibited poor boundaries by giving Ian some drinks and I apologized profusely many times to my brother and to his wife. I completely owned up to my poor judgement and made no excuses for it. I'm not Ian's parent and I don't make the rules for him. But I feel like the degree of outrage expressed by my brother is disproportionate to my transgression. Especially considering that my brother drank when he was a teenager. And now I don't have a relationship with my brother anymore and I really miss him. Is he over-reacting or AITA?",

(My friend also has ADHD and is visually impaired and his parents were very strict and not super nice to him; issues my son does not have). Anyway, I said any comparison between his parents (25 years ago mind you) and our parenting makes no sense. This was all by text so I concluded the argument by saying we could resolve it by having a conversation rather than texting.\nI left it alone and the next day he texted me, piling on even more criticisms about how i treat my stepson. I call him, and huge fight proceeds. My main points that I was trying to make was that he is a) not a parent and doesn't underatand the learning needs of my stepson b) he doesnt have the information to make the sort of broad generalizations since he only sees my stepson a couple times a year c) i didn't ask for his opinion and that only my husband should be the one who i am discussing this with and d) it's very hurtful to hear that I'm mistreating my stepson when I actually have a really good and loving relationship with him, that I've worked hard at cultivating over 6 years.\nMy friend stated that he feels bad for my stepson and sarcastically, \"oh you're so perfect you can't take some criticism?!\" and other really harsh judgements. It seems he wanted me to accept his judgement that I am mistreating my stepson. My husband for the record thinks this is absolutely ridiculous and knows how much quality time and love i give to his son, I (we) just have expectations for homework being done and trying his best (normal parent stuff, IMO). Its my opinion that my friend's traumatic experiences with his own very strict parents is what triggered this whole thing, and he is projecting. \nI'm having a hard time with this. We have been friends for more than 10 years. But i just can't imagine being friends with someone who says they feel bad for my stepson, like I'm such an awful person. And to impose their opinions on such a personal issue that should be an issue reserved for my husband and I. Plus, he yelled at me in a way I have never heard out of him.

College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don’t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn’t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING.

I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn’t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked.

I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that we had received word from admissions of your acceptance to (the university)! Congrats...that's great news. I also wanted to make sure you knew we are very interested in you joining our team.\n\nWe had not received an actual acceptance letter yet, but since this was the heads of one of the athletic teams at the university, we didn't think anything was amiss.  My sister replied, and the coach then mentioned her coming to visit with the team and that he would be \"losing two breaststrokers to graduation this year and so it would be awesome to have someone of your caliber come in and join us.\"\n\nMy sister, me, and the rest of my family were ecstatic, and she was so happy when the official letter from the university was mailed in.\n\n...except, she wasn't accepted. \n\nMy sister was in tears.

After looking through my past communications and reviewing information, I believe I know what happened.\n\n&gt; During the time I emailed (sister), I was emailing people who had both \"recently applied\" and other who had been \"accepted\" during the Early Action process. I inadvertently emailed (sister) the wrong email. I cannot begin to express my sincerest apologies for this error. In regards to the visit days (other coach) has been communicating, it is customary practice to try to plan ahead with recruits while they are awaiting decisions. I apologize if this was clear.\n\nMy entire family is furious. My sister is irreparably upset. My sister has spent the last several months living the stressful nightmare that is college admissions, especially since she wants to continue her athletic career. She was so elated beyond belief, and now she had been told that this is a \"mistake.\"\n\nI took screenshots of the email thread and put them on social media for the public to see. We need everyone to understand why we are so monumentally disappointed in the university for this because this should never happen to any other student-athlete. The college admissions process is all over the news, and my sister's story needs to be heard.\n\nBut then several people (two lucky ones in particular who are already students at the university and are on the swim team), are saying that while they are sorry for my sister that it's wrong for me to bring up these emails publicly.

Which means it’s also only the third time in a year, I’ve had any kind of break from 4 kids. Don’t get me wrong, I LOVE my kids, but I’m fucking exhausted. Plus caught a nice case of walking pneumonia. Not how I wanted to spend my two days off.\n\nSo the ex comes to pick up the kids this morning. He tells me his parents drove in from out of town without telling anyone except his sister. They called her when they were 6 hours away (they live about 13 hours away) to let her know they’d be arriving and staying at her house that night. My Ex-FIL also declares that my ex should ‘round every up Saturday’ so he can give my oldest a watch for his birthday. (My oldest’s birthday is on Tuesday.) I’m annoyed as fuck. Who does that?! Anyway, the ex, knowing I’ve been sick and knowing I’m not going to be thrilled about changing my plans at the last minute tells his dad that today won’t work but maybe tomorrow. \n\nI thought about it for a minute. Part of me is like: well I should be nice and accommodate them. They live really far away, etc. But then my bitch side turned back on and I said no.

		"story": "Background info, I did post a while ago about my roommate not paying rent, etc. This is a totally different topic. \n\nMy SO and I adopted a puppy, who we will call Koda. He was part of a litter of five large breed mixed puppies found right before Florence hit. He was from Kentucky, and we were in contact with the rescue and explained our situation--I work from home most of the week and My SO works Monday/Wednesday/Friday/Saturday. We puppy-proofed the house, bought a lot of toys, talked to our vet to prepare for him, etc. We originally asked to foster, but were denied, and after speaking to his foster, we were told he would be fine as an only dog but could also have other dogs in the house without a problem. We have fostered with them before, but never foster failed, so we are experienced dog folks. \n\nWe fostered two dogs when he came to us originally, but within one week of Koda coming to us, our adult male foster dog who played with Koda regularly went to a foster to adopt situation, and Koda threw a fit. He cried, barked, did not eat, did not sleep, did not play. Just laid in his crate all day and barked. He had barked before this, and was mourning his litter mates for about 24 hours after leaving them, but settled quickly. When the male foster dog left, it lasted days. Our female foster cuddled up to him, and played with him and was his buddy. When they were together, I could leave him unsupervised for 20  minutes without a problem (in a puppy proofed room). He was 12 weeks when this all happened. \n\nFast forward two weeks, all is well, but then our female foster gets adopted. Koda goes through the whole routine again, and we talked to the rescue to see if they could give us advice on how to help Koda with the transition. We are basically told that if we love him enough, we will figure it out and find a way to make it work for him as a single dog. Koda makes himself sick over the loss of Jill. The stress of it literally made him ill--diarrhea, vomiting, not eating, etc. Took him to the vet and she agreed it was basically acute stress though we had done our best not to change his routine. We nurse him back to health slowly and we are encouraged to keep him quiet for a few days till he feels better. \n\nEventually he does. We wean him back onto his normal schedule, diet, etc. We think he is going to be fine as an only dog, but suspect he would be happier in a house with kids or other dogs. We bring it up to the rescue again and again. Due to my job, I couldn't adopt another dog until March, but I am very worried about him since he seems less energetic/happy ever since he was an only dog. Also due to my job, I wasn't in the position to foster again at this point. \n\nOne morning, we put him in his crate to go grab breakfast one day--we are gone forty five minutes or so. It is probably the first time he has been home without me since the female foster left. My roommate is home, so he isnt alone. I come back and he is throwing up and in distress. Take him to vet, same thing, stress response. I talked to the rescue again (fourth or fifth time) and say that after talking with my vet, it is agreed that he needs another dog so that he wont be so distressed when we leave the house. After explaining, I am told that I am a horrible owner and that I need to consider his needs before my own, and that \"who was I\" to make the judgment that he was so stressed out by all of this? Vet ran blood, urine, and fecal, and besides a bladder infection and one roundworm in his throw up (which didn't show in the fecal), he was healthy. \n\nI love this dog and am very attached to him. But due to the health issue, doggy day care isnt willing to take him.\n\nThings have devolved to the point that if he is alone for more than 30 seconds, he is in severe distress, and we are concerned he will self harm. We also do not want him to make himself physically Ill every time we leave the house even for a short time. This also applies to when he cannot see us, such as showers.\n\nWe have exhausted all possible ways of keeping him with the resources we have and felt like surrendering him so we could get him into a home was the best thing to do for him. This is a first for us, since pets are for life in my house, but we also tried to put his needs first--and he needs someone home all the time, and another dog, or he will make himself sick. \n\nTL;DR: we do love the dog and are not wanting to surrender because it is \"convenient\". We want to do so because given the separation anxiety, confirmed by vet, we feel we do not have any options because he is making himself physically Ill if my SO, another dog, or myself aren't there. We do have a potential adopter lined up for him that would meet all of his needs that is pre screened through the rescue. We agreed to surrender him and foster him so we could find him the perfect home and we think this is it and the rescue agrees. Are we the assholes for making this decision? ",

I'm proud of myself for being able to do this despite being at so many doctor's offices and being in pain most of the time throughout this, and it's a really big deal for me to be graduating on time with the rest of my friends.\n\nAnyway, my mom wants to celebrate my graduation along with my uncle's birthday, my grandpa's birthday, AND father's day all rolled into one. I don't want to be ungrateful, but it really bothers me that so many things will be going on and I feel like no one really cares about me graduating. It's being treated like a thing that comes around once a year when it took so much effort and time to do. Plus, I don't know how my uncle, grandpa, and other dads in our family feel about it being lumped together too. I'd hate to be lumped in no matter what was happening, but I'm especially upset because it's graduation for me.\n\nI told my mom about my concerns, and she said, \"well the weekend in June we're celebrating on is the only free weekend we have, so it makes sense to do it all at once\". I told her \"I get that, but then I can't invite my few friends to the party because we're doing a bunch of family things. And what about grandpa and uncle xyz; they probably won't feel special being lumped together with me. I know I don't being lumped in with them.\" She kinda brushed it off and said we'll just celebrate as a family and to get over it, we're still celebrating.\n\nI feel bad asking for extra work to be put in and another party separate from everything, but I really don't think it's fair to lump my graduation with things that happen every year, especially given how hard it was for me. Am I the asshole for asking to have a separate graduation party?",

I have been close friends with F since my birthday in 2017. We are like twins and we got along great. I love her dearly. At that time, I was in a relationship with N, a man who was all in all just great. \n\nF and I have been through this and thin in the coming years since we met. All until the circumstances that placed her living with N while he and I were still dating. I lived in another city. Distance dulled the relationship. I should have seen it coming, but N broke up with me. I never suspected anything. F was my best friend who I trust dearly. And I still do love and trust my ex. I wasn't bitter towards him, even if I was taken by surprise of the break up. \n\nF and N continued to live together while I lived in another town. Time went on and I had a gut feeling that they were dating. I didn't mind that at all, however it was a hard time for me. I was hoping they would tell me so that I can at least get some closure during hard times of losing my relationship. They never said anything. And the feeling only got worse and sickening. I became depressed.\n\nI didn't want to visit them even if they wanted me to. I would make up excuses to avoid the awkwardness. I had to process the hurt, all while suppressing the temptation to ask F if she was dating my ex. I did visit them a couple of times and I had a blast. We hang out and get along like family. I still love them and they're still my best friends that I hold dear to my heart.\n\nWhich is why it's so painful to finally have a confirmation that they have been dating for almost 6 months and wouldn't tell me out of fear of losing me. I understand that completely. Shoot, posting this is probably proving their point. But that's why I'm doing it, I guess. But it does still hurt. I personally believe I could have moved on and grown much more effectively with knowing from the beginning.\n\nSo I have approached them and told them how I felt.

So here it goes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've (M20) been with my gf (F21) for almost an year now. We were very happy at the beginning, lots of fun. She was in college taking her degree and we used to talk about when we were both off college, we would have a great life. We would both work and have lots of gamer equipment and so (we're both gamers).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter 1 ou 2 months into the relationship she got sick with ulcerative colitis. Its a disease that affect your largest intestine and limitates you quite a bit. You will have crisis which will give you lots of pain and need to go to the bathroom, sometimes there will be blood on your feces.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome of the triggers of the crises are stress. And my gf is one of the most stressed persons I've known. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs some of you may know, stress is very, very stressfull. And Due to the stress of college and problem with her colleagues there. She felt that she should drop college and start working right away, she said she didnt like her course so she didn't want to have a degree. I didn't really liked the idea, but OK, she's sick, I might aswell support her (at the start she got mad at me because I wanted her to get a degree, I was latter convinced).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter dropping college she started working at a caffe at her local supermarket. But know she says the work is too stressfull and she doesn't want to work anymore. She wants to stay at home. And she says she wants that to be her new job. She will cook for me, clean the house and watch the kids. I don't like the idea at all. I know for a fact that she is very lazy, and she'll probably will get tired of doing that. But appart from that I don't want to have a relationship like the ones of the previous century. I want a woman who works, who helps me pay the bills, because I will help her clean the house and cook. And I want a woman who is strong and motivated.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe thing is her disease. Whenever I say to her that she need to find a less stressfull job. She starts saying that if she gets a lot of crisis she will get cancer and die. And I can't do anything. Because if I say to her \"You should work, I don't want to pay the bills all alone\", she gets mad at me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole.

		"story": "(throwaway because my wife browses reddit and she’ll know this about her straight away, sorry for any formatting errors, I’m on mobile, TLDR at the end, etc)\n\nFirst of all, I know I’m not perfect, but please hear me out. I don’t know where to start so I’ll just get the elephant in the room out of the way:\n\nI’ve (29/M) been cheating on my wife (31/F) for a little over a year now, with another woman (20/F) that I think I love. \n\nMy wife and I met in college (UK - I think that’s high school in America?) and dated for about two years before I proposed. Things were smooth for almost a year, before my wife seemed to change. She was constantly rude, nagging at me for anything, making belittling comments. I began to spend more time at work to avoid her constant negativity. She was diagnosed with Narcissistic Personality Disorder and Bipolar Disorder. Still, I was sure we’d work through it, so I stayed with her. I believed I still loved her. \n\nTwo years after her diagnosis, my dad died in a car crash. While I was distraught, I couldn’t help but notice that my wife seemed almost glad. She’d never mentioned an issue with my parents, but any time I seemed sad about it, she’s say something like, “It’s for the best,” or “You should get over it soon.” \n\nMy brother took his loss harder than I did and turned to alcohol. As a favour, I took him in when his landlord turned him out. I work a lot, but my wife owns her own business and often works from home. I (wrongly) assumed that I could leave the two of them alone together, but while I was away, they would have sex. I found this out from a neighbour, who walked in on them when asking for a parcel. I also later found out he had been stealing from us as well. \n\nAs any sane person would, I kicked him out of my home. I tried to file for a divorce, but my wife went through an awful depressive episode, lasting almost a month. I dropped the ideas about a divorce. \n\nFor a while, things seemed to go back to how they were when I was 20. Things were going great at work and I was climbing the ranks. We’d just moved into a new house closer to my work. My wife had begun branching out and now owned two or three shops in the city. She was on a new medication that made her a much more pleasant person. Our sex life was great. \n\nAnd then we found out she was having a baby. I was ecstatic - I love kids. My wife and I had always wanted a kid, but every time we’d tried it hadn’t worked. Soon enough, our son was born. \n\nOver the course of his first couple of months, I began to have doubts that he was really my son. I put this off as first kid worries or whatever and continued with my life. Until one evening, my wife sat me down and told me the kid was my brothers. Her reasons were that ‘she knew I’d always wanted a kid’ and that ‘our DNA was too close for it to make a difference’. Never mind the fact that meant she was sleeping with my brother again. \n\nAgain, I distanced myself. I tried to file for a divorce again, but my wife returned to her depressive state, so once again, I dropped it. One night after an argument, I left the house with no intention of going anywhere and ended up in a bar. I got talking to a girl and we had a one night stand. \n\nI couldn’t help but think of my wife the whole time, and yet a week later I slept with her again. She told me things about herself - she was living with her cousin, she worked two jobs to put herself through uni, she felt like she was alone in the world. Our one night stand became a whole relationship and I realised that I was cheating on my wife. \n\nIt became a lot easier when I made her my secretary. I don’t want to explain many details about our relationship. She was by no means at fault. I didn’t tell her I had a wife until a month or so before I gave her the job. I didn’t tell her about my son until our first argument. \n\nI was spending a lot more time at work, and my wife began getting suspicious. She stopped taking her meds, telling me they ‘clouded her thoughts’ and refused to speak with her psychiatrist. Still, she doesn’t know about the other woman. \n\nReally, I know I am at fault for a lot of this, and a tragic backstory or whatever doesn’t let me off. But I really do think I’m in love with the woman I’m cheating with and I don’t know what to do.\n\nTLDR: my wife, who suffers from multiple mental illnesses, has put me through numerous hardships and now I’m cheating on her.

She was working in the hospitality industry so I ask her for a restaurant suggestion and she chooses an upscale place with a nice wine list. I make the reservation using the Open Table app.\n\nMy cousin is a pretty, blonde and polite young woman; basically the opposite of me. Our server turns up the charm to the point where it's becoming obnoxious. He’s not bad looking, but it was obvious that he was flirting. I’m about 15 years older and will be handling the bill, but I was immediately invisible as soon as she sat down.\n\nMy cousin and I order our meals and start to catch up. He interrupts us to ask what she does and she tells him she’s in the wine industry. He starts asking lots of questions because he’s interested in \"getting into that line of work\" (or so he says). Then, to my jaw-dropping surprise, he flat-out asks her how much she makes! Then he asks for her number in case he has any questions about \"getting his foot in the door\". I'm appalled but I lay low because this is my cousin's turf.\n\nHe returns to fill our waters (again) and instead of walking over to the other side of the table to refill her water, he LEANS over her, REALLY getting into her personal space. We wait for a few seconds until he finishes hovering over her to refill her water. It’s awkward.\n\nOur food arrives, and it’s all wrong. There was no apology from the server, almost like he didn’t want to admit his error, and we end up just eating what we were given. The bill comes and there’s no acknowledgment of the mixup. I pay the bill and leave a measly tip.\n\nThe next day I wrote a gentle review on Open Table. I merely outlined the events that had transpired (surely they spoke for themselves) and suggested that the server may need additional training. A few days later I get an ENRAGED text from my aunt pleading with me to remove the review. She said it was embarrassing to my cousin, who had connections with the restaurant (even though I didn't use any names). I apologized profusely. I didn’t want to make things more difficult for my cousin, I just wanted to stand up for her and thought the restaurant should know about their creepy server. In a text to my aunt, I said something like “You would have spoken up too if you saw the way this man treated your daughter.” It made me sad that society has taught my aunt and cousin to sacrifice their own dignity and safety for social acceptance.\n\nTL;DR Went to a fancy dinner with my young and pretty cousin and our server was a creep towards her.

Should I give them a written warning/notice taped to their car, I have already alerted the office, to which they'll alert the individual if the car is registered to the apartment via lease/paperwork\n\nI'll end saying I know none of my neighbors and do not wish to ever meet them.\n\n----\n\n**TLDR;** Cars keep parking in my paid reserved spot, other spots are open, often directly next to mine for a few cars, but mine is the only one shoveled *remotely* out to make parking/entering and exiting easier.  AITA for having them towed or should I just give them a one time pass as I did the other car a few weeks back?\n\n[Picture of reserved sign](https://i.imgur.com/5m7qbSE.jpg) in front of car that was cleared since Sunday after Saturday's last snowstorm.

Removed them from the file share after graduation, removing any live access they had to files pertaining the project or the research. They now have to request the files from the professor who oversaw the project. AITA?\n\nEdit: Holy shit long post but it's all kinda relevant for the analysis of whether of AITA\n\nGraduated May 2018. Spent two semesters doing 95% of the work for my 5-member groups Senior Project at an ABET accredited Engineering university. The other four members all had little interest in project topic. All were too busy to show up to project work sessions (literal bare minimum was 1 time per week and they couldnt even do that). This is even after the project mentor (tenured engineering professor) found us a dedicated lab space to work on our project without distractions from other groups. \n\nFall semester of senior year, I did 100% of the project research, planning, and structuring myself. Literally. The only assistance the other group members gave was in actually nearing theinformation, plans, project structuring into the formatted documentation we had to submit. I purchased preliminary parts, microcontrollers, sensors, etc on my own dime because group would not meet to sign paperwork to request university backed funding. Developed initial prototypes on my own in our dedicated lab space which everyone in the group had access to.\n\nSpring semester (implementation phase)-  4/5 days of the week, all the components and controllers remained in the lab space. 1/5 days and occasionally on weekends I would take home the server board or the microcontroller to do some code work. 3 days a week I spend a minimum of one hour working in lab space waiting on group members (our dedicated and officially scheduled by universitysenior project lab time). After the dedicated, scheduled hour - I would leave and remote in to our server from home OR occasionally take server or microcontroller home as above described. I self-funded all of the materials for the final project prototype sensors, server hardware, microcontrollers, lumber for display model, designed and set up our working model for project expo that would be viewed by peers, professors, and investors. One project member spent -one- hour lab period with me to construct the rolling model display. One project member had a family member who worked as a contractor and managed to get a distribution panel for us for free. TWO of the members (the one who helped build model, and one other who hadn't helped at all yet) showed up to the high-power lab on the day that I tested our sensors and full system and collected some preliminary data. However, I was only allowed to use this particular lab if I had another peer present (given the lab had kilovolt ranged 3 phase equipment) and I had to request special key card access from other university officials to even get us in there in the first place. \n\nAll in all I spent &gt;$500 on senior project. Two semesters of designing the hardware and software for a few custom sensor devices, designing a server and interface, countless hours of coding, soldering, circuit troubleshooting, data collection and analysis, etc. Countless hours alone in our dedicated \"group\" lab space, a literal locked room with equipment and computers, etc all for us specifically. At our expo event, where we were to present our research to peers, professors, and investors over a 4 hour period - I was the only one who spoke with any specifics or details about the research project. Any other members who spoke would do a basic introduction and hand it over to me or would very poorly try to repeat the way I had explained it to someone earlier in the day.\n\nI was just digging back through my university email, clearing out all the junk that has accumulated in the near year span that has passed since graduation. I just found an email where one of the group members had re-requested access to the project files on our file share this past fall semester (he did non graduate when I did). And now I'm wondering if im an asshole for withdrawing everyone's access.

I have never been mean to her and have constantly encouraged her. However, she hates me. I'm going to write you all the reasons why.\n\nReason 1. I constantly flirted with her sister. I complimented and flirted with her every time I saw her. I'm a horrible flirt. Her and her sister thought that I was weird and creepy. The last time I flirted with her was the third time I saw them. After that, her sister didn't want to see me. \n\nReason 2. Our mutual friend (and my best friend) had a crush on her and she rejected him. I told her to reconsider. She didn't like that. So after that, she has constantly been rude to me. After she started being rude to me, I told my friend to stay cautious around her and to keep everything platonic.\n\nReason 3. I am constantly a joker. It's a huge personality flaw of mine. However, I'm not a bully. I'm just a huge goofball and I'm okay with it. She isn't though. She told me my jokes are shitty and that everybody thinks so too.\n\nReason 4. We have opposing political, ethical, and religious beliefs. I am a Republican, she isn't. I'm a family guy, she isn't.

I was in shock. \n\nI was back early for reasons I don't want to disclose which means I was in town for Halloween. I called my friend to see what he was up to for Halloween and told me he was having a party. So I came. She and her sister was there with 3 other friends.

To be clear, this was not a striped crosswalk, just an intersection in a residential neighborhood where the sidewalk continues off the curb. The car was pulled forward just far enough for the back bumper to barely clear the intersection. All foot traffic would have to walk through the middle of the intersection to get around. This was totally unnecessary because there was plenty of other parking -- there were 4 or 5 other available spots within half a block.\n\nMy dog had just taken a nice, big, well-formed shit with a nice solid consistency, and I had scooped it (because I'm not the kind of asshole who doesn't clean up after their dog, though I may be some other kind of asshole), so was carrying it in a baggie.

He told me that everyone in fact gets $20aud in the beginning but when he sees that they can carry parts of the bar themselves he would raise the salary to $25aud per hour. I wasn't happy being lied to but accepted it and figured I'll just put the hours in until he bumps up the salary.\n\nNow for a while I've been able to work easily on my own, taking care of the bar without help.

I enjoy cooking and am on a bit of a budget (I support myself) so I cook 3 meals a day, 7 days a week (since I can’t afford to eat out). \n\n\nStarting when we first moved in, I started noticing things were off with my food. Not that things were missing (although sometimes I would have less of something than I thought) but also that I would sometimes have more, of a different product than I remember buying (ie going to eat some crackers and them being kinda whole grain-y despite the box saying original).

I understand there’s something wrong with her but it’s not like she can’t control herself at the grocery store and eats right off the shelves, or at restaurants takes from other people’s tables.

They were talking about different things they were looking forward to, and my son made a joke, saying, \"And of course, I'm sure we'll look forward to dropping the kids off at Grandma and Grandpa's house every now and then.\"\n\nI laughed it off for a moment, but said, \"I wouldn't count on that.\"\n\nHe got confused and asked what I meant, and I ended up having to tell him rather plainly that he shouldn't expect me and his mother to act as babysitters for his grandchildren. That we'd raised one child, and we were done and happy to focus on us, our lives, etc. My son was visibly upset by this, and said \"But you're going to be grandparents. Shouldn't you WANT to spend time with your grandkids?\"\n\nMy wife spoke up and said that yes, we would be happy to spend time with them, but that we weren't going to be babysitters, we wouldn't be raising them, we would spend them with the *family*, not *just* the grandkids -- we would not be free daycare or babysitting, we would not be taking them on trips, spoiling them, etc. She made a point to say, \"I'm sorry if this isn't what you expected. We will of course be a part of their lives, but we aren't here to be taken advantage of. Your children aren't our responsibility. We don't have a choice if you have them or not. It's your life and your choice, but please don't expect us to sacrifice ours.\"\n\nWell, it all blew up. My son said he just assumed all parents were dying for the moment when they had grandkids, that there's something wrong with us, he can't believe he'd be so cold to our (not even born yet) grandchild, etc etc. \n\nSo I have to ask.

Long story short, he ends up sleeping on my bathroom floor after I drive everyone to my place. My step dad, who didn't know the friend was in the bathroom, ends up tripping over my sleeping friend during the night and ends up jamming his thumb. \n\nThe following day, my friend apologizes to my step dad and everything is forgiven but my step dads thumb is still jammed. After a few days, my friend asked how my step dads thumb was doing and I have the realization that the only way my friend could get information about my step dads health was through me, so I kept the story going. In reality, my step dads thumb felt fine a day or two after jamming it but I told my friend something along the lines of \"his thumb is really bothering him, he's planning on going to the doctor tomorrow.\" \n\nFast forward a week, my friend asks about my step dad again and I feed him something along the lines of \"he was doing a little work on his car and fell back on his thumb and it's broken now.\" This trend continues for at least 6 weeks with the final story ending up being that my step dad had broken his hand so he couldn't work (contracting/construction), leading to things getting tight with money, even dipping into my college fund to pay bills and all the random expenses that kept popping up, etc etc. I got some friends and even my mom to contribute to the story in little ways like with an off comment about seeing my step dad in a cast, etc.\n\nWeek 6 of the joke rolls around and my friend is back at my house for the first time since the thumb jamming incident. He then apologizes to my mom and she looks at me and says is \"Oh, you still haven't told him?\" to which I finally reveal it was a joke and that my step dad was fine since day 2.\n\nI recently told this story to a couple of newer friends and they told me they thought that what I did was kind of fucked up which got me wondering, AITA in this story?\n\nTL;DR I fed my friend false information for 6 weeks and basically convinced him he caused my family financial stress as a joke",

She had her for about maybe a month and a half, but she four very uncontrollable and energic children and they constantly abused and terrified the kitten. The youngest was the worst as he's very violent and she has absolutely no control over him, he has a whole history that I won't get into for family reasons, but he treated the kitten like a stuffed toy. He constantly sat on her, pulled her tail, squished her head, etc. He is young, but by the age of six he should really understand how to treat an animal. \n\nWe took care of the kitten for a weekend in the month they had her, because my aunty came to our house crying that her son was literally going to kill it if he continued. They took her again and we didn't see her for a couple weeks, until we finally 'adopted' her. She's scared of the lot of them when they come to visit and I always have to lock her in a spare room with my other cat so she's not alone.

That's a fuck load of food and cat litter. Two of the cats are outdoor cats and aren't that expensive, but they still require vet check ups.\n\nIn reality, we will probably just pay for the bills because we're not very confronting and demanding, but it's worth a shot to see whether we're in the right or wrong?\n\nTldr: My aunty handed us her kitten after her children abused it and she no longer wanted to care for her.

Ultimately, it's okay to end a relationship if you feel incompatible, but aim to do so with empathy and understanding. If someone is not willing to change for their own reasons, it’s their choice, and it's also your right to decide what you want in a partner."

I work in IT and my office is right next to the front door which leads to a nice garden area. \n\nI'm working away when I hear a bunch of screaming coming from the admin ladies. This happens quite regularly, sometimes spiders or even lizards make their way inside. As expected,  they tell me there's a MASSIVE spider just outside the front door.\n\nI go outside and sure enough there's a great big bloody Huntsman spider - almost as big as an average persons hand. It's close to the gap in the front door and the next stop will most likely be in our office. \n\nNo worries, I'll kill it with my giant ruler! So I go outside and  proceed to kill it when the coffee shop lady (who came over due to the screaming) starts screaming at me to leave it alone. She is particularly upset, shaking her head, calling me an asshole and almost crying. Saying I should have just left it. Most the admin ladies thanked me (except one, who also said she would've just left it) and the coffee shop lady. Am I an asshole? ",

		"situation": "I will try to keep this as concise as possible. I (F25) have moved to another country when I was 18 for study and where I remained to work now. I got my own apartment recently and my mom came to visit this week. Of course, i offer for her to stay with me now that i finally have my own apartment without roomates, but I do know she is very particular with cleanliness since I lived under her roof for 18 years. So,before her arrival i paid for (very expensive) deep cleaning to an already cleaned apartment just to make sure it was super thoroughly cleaned. Once she arrived, i had still a few calls (remote work) and i see she put on curtains in the middle of the day in my living room making it very dark , I ask why she did that, to which she responds; “how do u live like this watching the dust fall on your (glass) coffee table? Should i call someone to remove the (top) glass layer?”. I said i dont mind it and no need to replace. She also rearranged many many things in the apartment while i was on the call. I go grocery shopping, and once i got back i see she started a load of laundry of my clothes that was in MY closet. I get super triggered for obvious privacy reasons, not to mention cleaning already cleaned clothes. I ask her not to do that again to which she took big offence. Mind u ive lived and done my laundry since im 18. Next day - another online meeting - she comes in with my jacket to show me how i have a tissue in the pocket and that i shouldnt do that as it could clog my washer. She also after my call told me she will wash my backpack, to which i saw all my things taken out of it laid out on the table as she prepares it to be washed (tnx GOD i didnt have anything inappropriate in that bag). This makes me flip tho for 1. Interrupting my call bc of this 2. Going through my pockets and backpack (again which i percieve as invasion of privacy) and i tell her it would be best to get an airbnb on her own. To which she again took big offense and cried. AITA?",

		"situation": "So yesterday, I went to go see my little sister's play at her school. She's been working hard on it for 6 months, and she was really excited for me to go, and like a good sibling would, I did! Everything started off normal, the play was cute, and the acting was good for middle schoolers. For context, the play was called *The Assembly* and its premise was students at an assembly misbehaving. From time to time, there were announcements over the \"intercom\" my sister was making. About 25 minutes into the play, there was announcement that said \"Can \\*my name\\* come to the office please?\" I thought it was cute, and they were using my name as a cameo because I was in the same theatre group when I was in middle school. That was, until, a cast member yanked me out of my seat and dragged me to the back of the audience. I have severe social anxiety, and no one told me. She told me to stay here until the end of the show. 15 minutes go by, and the show ended. &#x200B; I hightailed it out of the theatre so no one would say anything to me, and I had a panic attack in the bathroom. (Like I said, I suffer from social anxiety). After a 15 minute panic attack, I went outside where everyone was congregating, and my mom said she knew about that the whole time. I told my mom I didn't feel comfortable doing that, and I had a panic attack after the fact, but she told me I was being an asshole and I should have just did it without a problem. Now, of course I would have agreed to it if I was told before the performance, but just doing that without consent? That didn't sit right to me. So, reddit, am i the asshole here or am i just being dramatic?",

		"situation": "UPDATE: Got home from work today and my neighbor ran over to apologize about the mixup, they clearly were lied to and I don’t hold it against them!! I offered to let them use my mower if they need it before it snows. Hopefully I won’t hear from the son again :) I had a next door neighbor who recently passed away. He was in his 80s and I mowed his lawn for him every couple weeks whenever I’d do my own, since he told me he couldn’t physically do it anymore. He offered to pay me but I never took any payment from him. Anyways, when he passed his son told me he was going to sell the house. He offered me some money to keep mowing until they get it sold, I said sure. New neighbors moved in a couple weeks ago now and they haven’t mowed once. (Granted we are getting close to mowing being done for the year, but we probably have at least one or two mows left lol) Yesterday, new neighbor left a note on my door while I was working asking when their yard would be done. I went over to talk to them and explained that I mowed for my former neighbor because of his age, and for the son because he was paying me. If they wanted me to mow their lawn they were gonna have to pay. (They’re a married couple around my age, mid-late 20s btw) Apparently the son (or realtor?) told them that my mowing services come with the house. That I mowed for the last owner and his son, and I’ve agreed to mow for them as well. I literally laughed and told them nope, I never offered that. I again said Id do it if they paid me but they didn’t want to so I left. The son is now reaching out to me since the new neighbors called to complain to him. He thought since I was helping his dad “out of the kindness of my heart” I’d do the same for any neighbor. New neighbors specifically didn’t buy a lawn mower because he told them this. I stood firm and said nope. AITA?",

		"situation": "I (14F) HATE sauces. Like I get physically sick when I taste it. On the other hand, my dad(47M) loves it. As weird as it sounds, the texture if sauces and the taste of them don't sit right with me. Even if I take sauce off of something, I can't eat a meal if it still tastes like it. My dad got me mcdonalds for dinner since didnt feel like cooking and I got a plain cheeseburger (no fries). Everything on it said plain so I didnt feel the need to check the burger. Well, when we got home I discovered the burger had everything on it, including ketchup and mustard. I tried scraping it off with a knife but it was just taking all the cheese and stuff off it so I didnt want to eat it. I told my dad this and he was telling me my attitude is disgusting and that I'm horrible.  He knows that I cant have ketchup or mustard but he told me to suck it up since it wasnt an allergy. So now, all I've had to eat is a slice of toast (unbuttered cause his girlfriend used the last of it to bake a stupid cake) and I'll get food at school tomorrow for lunch since I don't eat breakfast and he doesnt wake up until later on for work. As much as I'd love to cook for myself, I genuinely cannot cook. It's just something I can't do. I managed to burn curry powder and water once and had a microwave pudding explode all over the microwave so those can probably paint a decent picture. I also was the one who paid for it using money my mum gave me so it's not as if it's wasting his money either. I feel like im acting incredibly spoiled and feel bad but he wont talk to me. It's 7pm but im probably gonna try to sleep so I don't feel hungry later. So, AITA for refusing to eat a burger?",

		"situation": "1 (15M) and my Sister(4F) have not had a very close relationship. My mom had an affair with another man and as a result my sister was born, my mom got full custody in court so I can never see my dad without my moms permission which she would never give. Since the day my sister has been born I’ve been jealous of her because my step dad and my mom favor her over me, which is surprising because she acts like a spoiled brat but my mom and step dad will give her whatever she wants all the meanwhile neglecting me. One day my mom and step dad went out and forced me to babysit her instead of going out with my friends. We went to a corn festival by my house, which has a corn maze and a corn field. My sister and I went into the corn maze, as we were walking through it, a storm started to appear. By the time we got out, it was pouring. But suddenly my sister ran straight toward the corn field. I yelled at her “Come over here!” And she responded with, “No, I don’t want to go home!” and started to cry. As she began to have a tantrum one of the festival staff ran up to me and told me to get back quick or we could get caught up in the storm, or more specifically a tornado that was coming straight for our area. I assumed that one of the rescue staff would come and save her so without thinking i left. Me and my sister both ended up fine and were able to get back to the main building at the entrance of the festival. when we got home I explained this to my parents and they got extremely angry and grounded me for a month they also told my relatives and now they all think i’m a selfish teenager that doesn’t care about my sisters life. Now I look back and wonder if i’m in the wrong because I didn’t help protect my sister so… am I the asshole??",
